## Categorization Logic

The organization script uses intelligent content analysis:

1. **Filename patterns** - Identifies explicit categories (journal, todo, planner)
2. **Content scoring** - Weighted analysis of content patterns:
   - **Reading indicators:** References, technical content, person names as titles
   - **Writing indicators:** "Tags: Idea", personal perspectives, original thoughts
   - **Journal indicators:** Dated entries, personal reflections
   - **ToDo indicators:** Checkboxes, action items, job applications
3. **Priority system** - When scores tie: Reading > Writing > Journal > ToDos

## Files Preserved

All original files remain in `rawMaterials/notionBackup/` - nothing was deleted. The organized folders contain copies with cleaned filenames (hash suffixes removed).

## Next Steps

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Review categorization** - Spot-check files to ensure they're in the right folders
2. **Manual adjustments** - Move any miscategorized files as needed
3. **Further organization** - Consider creating subfolders within categories:
   - `Reading/AI-ML/`
   - `Reading/Health/`
   - `Writing/Ideas/`
   - `ToDos/JobApplications/`

### For Future Paper Writing:
- **Reading folder** contains your research materials and references
- **Writing folder** has your original ideas to build upon
- **Journal folder** may contain insights and reflections
- Consider creating a `Papers/` or `Drafts/` folder for works in progress

## Script Location

The organization script is saved at: `/Users/zan/z/attention/organize_notion.py`

You can re-run it anytime with:
```bash
cd /Users/zan/z/attention
python3 organize_notion.py
```

## Notes

- 340 files were skipped (mostly date-based habit trackers with minimal content)
- All files with substantial content (>50 characters beyond title/metadata) were preserved
- Filenames were cleaned by removing Notion's hash suffixes for better readability
