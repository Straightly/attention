# Attentions is all you need

Attention is all you have.  As a human, that is all you have to offer.  Time is of essence.  You have to pay attention to what is at hand.  So the best software we can write for a provider is take his attention to what matter the most.  Granted, we cannot do all that.  We can only suggest.  But thankfully, that is all that we need to do.  My EMR is completely focused on attention first.  It is focussed on a slider of “what’s new”, since last encounter?  Since the encounter before? since last year?  Since last diagnosis?
