## Abstract

"Vibe programming" represents a paradigm shift in software development where developers use natural language to describe intent rather than manually writing code. Coined by Andrej Karpathy in early 2025, the term describes a coding approach where programmers "fully give in to the vibes" and let LLMs generate code based on natural language descriptions. This paper documents a personal 25-day journey of vibe programming using the Windsurf/Cascade AI coding assistant, analyzing 107 recorded prompts across multiple projects. Through this empirical lens, we examine the practical realities, benefits, limitations, and emergent patterns of programming in English—what Karpathy called "the hottest new programming language."
