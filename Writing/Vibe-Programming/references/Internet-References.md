### 1. A Survey of Vibe Coding with Large Language Models
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/html/2510.12399v1  
**Type:** Academic paper (arXiv)  
**Date:** 2025

**Key Contributions:**
- Formal definition of vibe coding as "dynamic triadic relationship" between Human-Project-Agent
- Mathematical framework: 𝒱=⟨ℋ,𝒫,𝒜θ⟩
- Constrained Markov Decision Process model
- Development models: UAM, ICCM, PDM, TDM, CEM
- Open challenges: code reliability, scalable oversight, human factors

**Notable Quotes:**
> "Vibe Coding represents a dynamic triadic relationship among human developers, software projects, and Coding Agents. In this paradigm, humans evolve from direct code authors into intent articulators, context curators, and quality arbiters."

## Andrej Karpathy's Contributions

### 6. "The Hottest New Programming Language is English"
**Source:** Andrej Karpathy (Twitter/X, talks)  
**Date:** 2023

**Context:**
- Observation about LLM capabilities
- Humans no longer need to learn specific programming languages to command computers
- Foundation for vibe coding concept

**Related Concepts:**
- Software 1.0: Computer code
- Software 2.0: Neural network weights
- Software 3.0: Prompts

### 7. Autonomy Slider Concept
**Source:** Andrej Karpathy (Cursor anatomy discussion)

**Levels:**
- Tab: Autocomplete (minimal autonomy)
- Cmd+K: Inline edit (moderate autonomy)
- Cmd+L: Chat mode (high autonomy)
- Cmd+I: Agent mode (maximum autonomy)

**Parallel in Perplexity:**
- Search → Research → Deep Research

**Relevance:** Framework for understanding different levels of AI assistance.

### 8. Verification Loop Principle
**Source:** Andrej Karpathy

**Key Principles:**
1. Make verification EASY and FAST
2. Keep AI "on a tight leash" to increase probability of successful verification
3. Agents are overrated: "An agent generating 1000 lines of code is of no use to me if I have to read through them and verify it"

**Design Questions:**
- Can an LLM "see" all the things the human can?
- Can an LLM "act" in all the ways a human can?
- How can human supervise and stay in the loop?
- How does the diff look?

**Relevance:** Core design philosophy for effective AI-assisted development.
