## Core Insights

### 1. The Paradigm Shift
**Traditional:** Programming is writing code  
**Vibe Programming:** Programming is articulating intent

### 2. The Skill Shift
**Traditional:** Syntax, algorithms, debugging  
**Vibe Programming:** Communication, domain knowledge, verification

### 3. The Productivity Equation
**Speed:** 4-5x faster development  
**Breadth:** Cross-domain capability  
**Cost:** Higher verification overhead

### 4. The Human Element
Vision, judgment, context, responsibility, creativity remain irreplaceable

### 5. The Verification Principle
Small, verifiable increments > Large autonomous agents

## Notable Quotes

> "The hottest new programming language is English." — Andrej Karpathy

> "Make verification EASY and FAST. Agents are overrated. An agent generating 1000 lines of code is of no use to me if I have to read through them and verify it." — Andrej Karpathy

> "Programming has always been about communication—communicating intent to machines."

> "Vibe programming isn't replacing traditional programming; it's revealing what programming always was: the art of clearly specifying what we want and verifying we got it."

> "The AI is a powerful collaborator, not a replacement."

## Best Practices Summary

### Prompt Design
✅ Be specific about intent, not implementation  
✅ Provide context and examples  
✅ Request incremental changes  
✅ Use conversational language

### Verification
✅ Test immediately  
✅ Request explanations when needed  
✅ Keep changes reversible (git commits)  
✅ Verify each increment before moving forward

### Iteration
✅ Refinement loop: prompt → review → refine → repeat  
✅ Exploration: ask AI to propose approaches  
✅ Clarification: "I think you misunderstood me..."  
✅ Explicit reminders for persistent behaviors
