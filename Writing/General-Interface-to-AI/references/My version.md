Developers, are you ambitious enough with AI?

Everybody is using AI.  Anybody using AI is learning that how effective one is using AI depends on what questions one is asking AI.

We humans, of course, is limited, not by our imaginations, but by our day job.  So, in one of our Windsurf showcase, the example used was

“Expand the id field in this API to allow both long and string”.

Because the problem to solve was that we need to import data from two sources, one using a long as ID while the other use a string, which is an UUID.  Never mind that over loading an API is bad and the the code to dedup and merge will be a nightmare.

This was what we developers are train to do:  solve the specific problems at hand.  When we run into difficulties, the way to solve it is, of course, to become even more specific and narrow our scope enough until the problem is small and specific so a solution can be coded.  AI, of course, is used to code the solution and solve our problem.

We need to become more ambitious.  In the case above, maybe a better prompt would have been

“Change the API to import data sourced from these two sources, their formats are respectively this and that?  Here are some examples.  Merge the results into a structure that keeps all important information but remove all duplicated?”

But why stop there?

A lot of software were written to interface between a computer and human.  Because the limitation of computer, which can ONLY handle structured data, we have painstakingly formatted our data and logics/knowledge into something even a computer can “understand”.  For that, we come up with languages like assembly, C, C++, Java, and finally Python.

With the advance of LLM, all that changed. The language of the day is now English.  Yet, we are using AI as a translator to translate our solution, expressed in English, into code in some computer language, all the while knowing that LLM can understand English.

As software developers, I was happy for a while as LLM was writing the code I need for my day job.  Then I realized LLM is way bigger than that.  So I asked AI this question:

As a software developer, AI can now writing code for me for my day job. What will happen next? What should I learn to prepare for that?

The answers are long and detailed, but as an experienced developer, I can tell it is still trying to help me to do my day job better, with AI’s help nonetheless, which is to say:  wrong.  I then realized my mistake was in the prompt, of course.

What do you think my question to AI should be?  Is the answer to the ultimate question truly 42?
