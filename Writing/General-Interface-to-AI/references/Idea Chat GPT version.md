## 💡 Developers — Are You Being Ambitious Enough with AI?

Everyone’s using AI now. But if you’ve been using it for a while, you’ve probably realized this: **the results depend entirely on the questions you ask**.

As humans, our limitations aren’t just imagination — they’re often tied to the constraints of our day jobs. For example, in one of our Windsurf showcases, we used a simple prompt:

> “Expand the id field in this API to allow both long and string.”
> 

Why? Because we had two data sources — one using a `long` ID, the other a `UUID` string. Never mind that overloading an API this way is bad practice, and the downstream deduplication logic would be a nightmare. Still, that’s what developers are trained to do: **solve the specific problem in front of us**.

When the problem is big, we break it down until it’s small enough to code — and now, we get AI to code the pieces. That’s useful, but it’s not enough.

---

## 🤔 What If We Were More Ambitious?

What if instead of asking AI to "make `id` accept both types," we asked something like:

> “Change the API to import data from these two sources, whose formats are X and Y. Here are examples. Merge the results to preserve all important fields and remove duplicates.”
> 

Now we’re thinking about the **goal**, not just the code. We’re using AI not as a code-writing assistant, but as a **system collaborator**.

## 🧠 We’ve Been Talking to Computers for Too Long

Most of software development — from assembly to Java to Python — exists because we had to speak a language a computer could understand. We spent decades encoding our logic and knowledge into structured forms.

But now, with LLMs, the dominant language is English. Yet most of us are still using AI as a *translator*, turning our English ideas into code, as if that were still the bottleneck.

It’s not.

## 🧭 What Comes After AI Writing Code?

At first, I was thrilled to have LLMs writing code for my day job. But then I realized: **that’s not the future — that’s the transition.** The real question isn’t *how can I code faster with AI?* It’s:

> What should I be doing now that AI can write the code?
> 

I asked AI that question. It gave me long, detailed answers — all focused on how to be a better developer *with AI's help*. Helpful, yes, but still rooted in the idea that my primary job is writing code.

That’s when I realized the flaw was in the prompt.

So now I’m asking myself — and you:

> What’s the real question we should be asking AI?
> 
> 
> Is the answer to the ultimate question truly just... 42?
>
