Software development is about building models.  One comes up a logic model, selecting the key information of our domain and write programs to implement the logic model for our purposes.  For example, an EMR system captures the information of a patient and help the provides manages the patient's medical and health needs. 
The first principal of software is that it is function which takes some inputs and returns some outputs and before LLM, building software is all about building this function.  For example, ML is all about tring to find the function by churning through a large amount of data.
But LLM changed this.  Now we already have a function.  It is a model which, thanks to the $billions spent by the piorneers, ALREDY BUILT.
Many AI projects are popping up and all claimed to be LLM projects.  What I noticed what that they are still trying to build the function.  With LLM, what they are trying to do is build on LLM, a function, a better function.
For example, tehre is an proposed architecture for using LLM.  My first impression was, WOW, that a lot of work to help LLM.  

Isn't LLM suppose to help me?  

So I propose an architecture like this:
