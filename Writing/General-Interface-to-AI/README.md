# General Interface to AI - Paper Project

**Created:** October 22, 2025  
**Status:** Active Development

---

## Overview

This folder contains a research paper exploring the concept of a "general interface" to AI systems. The paper examines how the shift from traditional programming to AI-based development requires fundamentally new interface paradigms.

## Contents

- **General-Interface-to-AI.md** - Main paper document
- **references/** - Source materials and related writings

## Key Themes

1. **Evolution of Interfaces**: From machine code → high-level languages → natural language
2. **The Three Categories**: Humans (GUI), Computers (API), Agents (English)
3. **Ambition Gap**: Moving from implementation-focused to intent-focused prompts
4. **Architecture Shift**: From deterministic logic engines to probabilistic behavior orchestrators
5. **The Autonomy Slider**: Balancing human control with AI agency
6. **Verification Loop**: Making AI verification fast and reliable

## Paper Structure

1. Introduction: The Evolution of Interfaces
2. The Three Categories of Digital Information Consumers
3. Beyond Code Translation: Rethinking Ambition
4. Architectural Implications: From Logic Engines to Behavior Orchestrators
5. The General Interface: Key Components
6. Interface Design Principles
7. Toward a Generic Agent Interface
8. Case Study: The Evolution of This Paper
9. Challenges and Open Questions
10. Conclusion: The Decade of Interfaces

## Reference Materials

The `references/` folder contains:
- Andrej Karpathy's insights on Software 3.0
- Analysis of traditional vs. AI-based development
- Your writings on AI ambition and developer mindset
- Notes on generic agents and interfaces
- Examples of API orchestration

## Next Steps

- [ ] Expand Section 7 with concrete protocols and data structures
- [ ] Add detailed security analysis (authentication, authorization, agent identity)
- [ ] Include more case studies of existing AI interfaces
- [ ] Comparative analysis of Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT interfaces
- [ ] Draft reference implementation proposal

## Vision

The goal is to articulate a comprehensive framework for how humans should interface with AI systems—not just for code generation, but for collaborative problem-solving across all domains. This paper aims to be both theoretical (proposing principles) and practical (suggesting implementations).
