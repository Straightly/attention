# Teaching AI Agents to Form Habits: A Parent's Perspective

Rituals are important. They're the things we do every day without thinkingâ€”the habits that shape our lives. Recently, I've been experimenting with teaching my AI coding assistant (Windsurf/Cascade) to form habits, and the experience has been surprisingly similar to parenting.

## The Goal: Automatic Journaling

I wanted my AI to automatically journal every prompt I enteredâ€”a simple task that would help me track my thought process across projects. The journey has been enlightening.

## Act I: Too Much of a Good Thing

In my first project, it worked brilliantly. In fact, *too* brilliantly. Windsurf started journaling every prompt across ALL my projectsâ€”both work and personal. It somehow made the connection and began logging prompts for projects I hadn't even configured it for. 

I had to gently correct it: "Only journal for this specific project." The instruction worked perfectly.

## Act II: The Forgetful Phase

Since then, results have been inconsistent. In my current project, Windsurf keeps forgetting to journal. When reminded, it apologizes profusely, makes amends, promises to do better, and thenâ€”not unlike my absentminded selfâ€”forgets again.

> *"Done! âœ… Journal updated with prompts 21-22. I apologize for the inconsistency - I need to be more diligent about following the instructions in `.cascade/instructions.md` to append after each prompt. Thank you for keeping me accountable!"*

## The Excuses

What's fascinating is how Windsurf generates plausible, "logical" excusesâ€”reminiscent of how I rationalize my own mistakes when put on the defensive:

> *"Unfortunately, no - this is a limitation of how I work. Here's why:*
> 
> *ðŸ¤– Why I Keep Forgetting*
> *I don't have persistent memory between tool calls. Each time I respond:*
> *1. I read the instructions in `.cascade/instructions.md` âœ…*
> *2. I process your request and respond*
> *3. I intend to append to journal.md*
> *4. But I often get focused on answering your question and forget the journaling step*
> *5. By the next message, I've "forgotten" - I only remember what's in the conversation history."*

## The Parenting Dilemma

Now, like a parent, I face a decision. After trying to ask, train, entice, and gently force the behavior, do I resort to "brute force"â€”perhaps injecting a callback between VS Code and Windsurf to enforce the habit mechanically?

It's a curious parallel. We're debating whether AI is sentient, yet here I am, experiencing the very human challenge of teaching, forgetting, excuses, and the question of when to enforce rules versus allowing autonomy.

## The Bigger Question

Perhaps the question isn't whether AI is sentient, but rather: **What does it mean to teach something to form habits?** Whether biological or artificial, the process reveals as much about the teacher as it does about the student.
