  He was very interested in my background. He has a PTMS position but it is in India.  His PTMS position was filled a couple of months ago.  He has positions but not PTMS positions.  He asked me if I would consider a lower ranked position and I said yes.  He is meeting with Bela Thursday and he will discuss this with her.

Samit Sasan.  
  11/17/2025 10:30am – 11:00am
  Met with him and he showed me some of his projects.  It seemed that he is still in the position of trying to get support from the AI team to get some of his ideas off the ground.  Further, his focus is on GraphQL and was trying to get me interested in that.

  She is very interested as she is not looking for a PTMS, nor anybody who did not have hands on experiences with ML.  She were not interested in LLM AI.
