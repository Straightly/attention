## Breaking News: Claude's Memory System (And Why I'm Building My Own)

Claude just announced a memory system! Exciting, right? Except... it wants to keep your memory and you have to pay for it.

I also read somewhere that AI agents, as new as they are, are already outdated. The new buzzword is "AI clones"â€”digital representations of yourself that are supposedly "more you than you realize yourself." Is that even possible? But I digress.

### What Memory Systems Do (And Why That's Good)

At its core, a memory system keeps texts and facts which, when attached to your prompt, help AI generate better responses. That's genuinely useful.

### But Here's What Bothers Me

**First: It's My Memoryâ€”I Should Control It**

AI is great. AI has become way smarter than I am. But it's my memory. How and when to use it is what makes me who I am. "I think therefore I am." AI and Claude are smarter than I am, but I would like to think for myself, thank you.

**Second: The Cost and Commitment Problem**

I don't like to payâ€”not just because of the money, but because I don't want to be forced into a way of thinking. Making a commitment to a service means committing to conform to how that service want you to think. I refuse to be pigeonholed into anything, Memory System from Claude included.

**Third: The Autonomy Problem**

Claude's memory stores "bio, tone, style, etc." My immediate reaction: Why would I want that?

I refuse to let anybodyâ€”Claude and AI includedâ€”produce anything dictated by profiling. I may want a humorous tone with formal style, but that's what **I** want to do. I want Claude to help me achieve my goals and enhance my experiences, not have the experiences for me.

What to use in producing a response is a value assessment. What gets added to my prompts should be my conscious decision, not delegated to AI.

**Finally: The Philosophical Problem**

This goes against my understanding of LLM. The interface to LLMs is just text: a string in and another string out. Why spend time and money learning a system that hides the LLM from me?

As a programmer, I believe in David Wheeler's principle: "Any problem can be solved by another layer of indirection." A memory system can just be a bunch of strings I keep somewhere and conveniently add to my prompt before sending it to an LLM.  If the LLM is free?  Icing!.

**So I'm starting an open source project: BrokenPencil.**

## The Problem: AI That Forgets (And Why That's Actually a Feature)

In my last post, I shared my experience teaching an AI coding assistant to journal my prompts. The results were inconsistent. The AI kept forgetting, apologizing, and forgetting again.

But here's what I realized: **This isn't a bug. It's a feature.**

Modern AI systems operate with:
- **Limited context windows** (like human short-term memory)
- **Stateless processing** (each conversation starts fresh)
- **No persistent memory** across sessions

This is actually good design. LLMs are supposed to be smart with vast knowledge and acute reasoning capabilities.  It has to be free of our biases and limitiations so it can be powerful.  It has also be free of the details of our cases (and our lives?) before it gets borgged down.  It is NOT some kind of clone of you which somebody by their wisdom think is "better than you" or "more you than you realize yourself".

## The Solution: External Memory You Control

The ancient proverb holds true: **"A broken pencil is better than the most sound mind."** Even AI needs to write things down.

Instead of fighting AI's forgetfulness or paying for proprietary memory systems, we can build a **memory layer** that:
- Works with any LLM (free or paid)
- Keeps you in control of what's remembered
- Helps you organize memories, but is open source so you're free to organize your way.
- Instead of build a "Memory System", we will be asking LLM to do it for us too.

The key insight:

> **Memory isn't about perfect recall or AI "knowing" you. It's about reliable externalization and convenient retrieval.**

### Core Components

**1. reliable externalization**
- Store texture data as momories.
- Organize memories by tags. Tag memories by project, topic, and any tags of your choice
- Version control everything (it's just text files!)
- **Note:** Windsurf suggested vector embeddings for semantic search. I'm skepticalâ€”convince me with a concrete use case.

**2. convenient retrieval**
- When you build a prompt, consciously select what memories to include
- Use Project/Thread Tag memory for organization andconvenience.
- **Note:** Windsurf suggested semantic similarity and prioritizing recent memories. Sounds like something to avoidâ€”we want conscious control, not algorithmic filtering.

**3. Memory Management: The Indirection**
- Review and edit what's stored
- Refactor and reorganize memories as needed
- We will, of course, use LLMs to help us with this. I was surprised that CLaude would would come up with a "System" and claim it is better than LLM for this.

### Why This Approach Works

âœ… **Free & LLM-agnostic** - Works with any LLM, no vendor lock-in  
âœ… **You control everything** - Choose what memories to attach, when, and how  
âœ… **Transparent & open source** - See what's sent, change how it works  
âœ… **Privacy-first** - Your data stays local or in your control  
âœ… **Simple & portable** - Just markdown files  
âœ… **No profiling** - You consciously add context, not AI learning your "style"

## Introducing BrokenPencil: An Open Source Project

I'm building **BrokenPencil** as an open source project on Bitbucket. You enter prompts, get enhanced prompts with selected memories attached, then send to any LLM website.  (footnote:  I just found out that Windsurf's none enterprise version has added a memory feature.  The feature was not available in the enterprise version.  It is my experiences that the free version of the LLMs are better than the paid API versions.  IMHO.)

### Project Goals

**Phase 1: MVP**
- Simple web app to add memories with tagging for organization
- Simple web app to apply memories to prompts
- Markdown-based for human readability
- Versioned local or self-hosted cloud storage

**Phase2: Brower Plugin**
- Chrome plug in to inject memories into prompts automatically, restored string in/string out interface to LLM.

**Phase 3: LLM Integration**
- LLM-assisted organization, refactoring and reorganization of memories
- Automatic memory extraction from conversations


### Technical Architecture

Windsurf suggested architecture that is impressive and would probably get budget approval.  It is way too complex and too irrelevant. 

Vetting Question: **"Design the permanent storage mechanism for memories and estimate implementation costs."** 

Hint: the mechanism is so obvious any qualified programmer should have it on the top of their mind.

## Real-World Use Cases

**Primary:** Stop repeating yourselfâ€”attach relevant context to prompts

**Stretch Goal:** Organize your memories better (though "better" is relative, especially when free LLM websites add implicit memory)

## Current Status & Next Steps

**Current Status:**
- âœ… Project repository created on Bitbucket
- âœ… Architecture design done

**Immediate Next Steps:**
- ðŸ“‹ MVP target: Build proof-of-concept web interfacesin a week or two.
- ðŸ“‹ Make it available to public users

## The Bigger Picture

BrokenPencil is part of a shift in how we interact with AI:

- **Stateless** â†’ **Stateful** (you control the state)  
- **One-off queries** â†’ **Ongoing conversations** (explicit context)  
- **Generic** â†’ **Contexted**  
- **Paid** â†’ **Free & open**

**The broken pencil principle:** External memory you control is better than AI that "betters" you.

## Your Thoughts?

I'd love to hear:
- What memory features would be most valuable to you?
- What concerns do you have about AI memory systems?
- What use cases am I missing?
- Would you use or contribute to something like this?

Drop a comment or reach out directly. Let's build better tools for working with AI.

**TL;DR:** AI systems forget because they're stateless. I'm building BrokenPencil, an open source mechanism that stores and retrieves memories and attach them to prompts. Free, LLM-agnostic, plexible. Looking for contributors.
