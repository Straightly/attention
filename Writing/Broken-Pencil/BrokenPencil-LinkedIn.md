## Breaking News: Claude's Memory System (And Why I'm Building My Own)

Claude just announced a memory system! Exciting, right? Except... it wants to keep your memory and you have to pay for it.

I also read somewhere that AI agents, as new as they are, are already outdated. The new buzzword is "AI clones"â€”digital representations of yourself that are supposedly "more you than you realize yourself." Is that even possible? But I digress.

### What Memory Systems Do (And Why That's Good)

At its core, a memory system keeps texts and facts which, when attached to your prompt, help AI generate better responses. That's genuinely useful.

### But Here's What Bothers Me

**First: It's My Memoryâ€”I Should Control It**

AI is great. AI has become way smarter than I am. But it's my memory. How and when to use it is what makes me who I am. "I think therefore I am." AI and Claude are smarter than I am, but I would like to think for myself, thank you.

**Second: The Cost and Commitment Problem**

I don't like to payâ€”not just because of the money, but because I don't want to be forced into a way of thinking. Making a commitment to a service means committing to conform to how that service want you to think. I refuse to be pigeonholed into anything, Memory System from Claude included.

**Third: The Autonomy Problem**

Claude's memory stores "bio, tone, style, etc." My immediate reaction: Why would I want that?

It's not that I don't trust Claude. It's that I refuse to let anybodyâ€”Claude and AI includedâ€”produce anything dictated by profiling of my bio, tone, or style.

I may want to add a humorous tone to my writings using a formal style. But that's what **I**â€”this conscious selfâ€”want to do. I want Claude to help me achieve my goals and to enhance my experiences, not to have the experiences for me.

At the practical level, what to use and what not to use in producing a response is a value assessment. What needs to be added to my prompts should be a conscious decision that I make, not delegated to AI.

**Finally: The Philosophical Problem**

This goes against my understanding of AI. The interface to LLMs is just text: a string in and another string out. Why spend time and money learning a system that hides the LLM from me?

As a programmer, I believe in David Wheeler's principle: "Any problem can be solved by another layer of indirection." A memory system can just be a bunch of strings I keep somewhere and conveniently add to my prompt before sending it to an LLM.  If the LLM is freely accessble, so much for the better.

**So I'm starting an open source project: BrokenPencil.**

## The Problem: AI That Forgets (And Why That's Actually a Feature)

In my last post, I shared my experience teaching an AI coding assistant to journal my prompts. The results were inconsistent. The AI kept forgetting, apologizing, and forgetting again.

But here's what I realized: **This isn't a bug. It's a feature.**

Modern AI systems operate with:
- **Limited context windows** (like human short-term memory)
- **Stateless processing** (each conversation starts fresh)
- **No persistent memory** across sessions

This is actually good design. LLMs are supposed to be smart with vast knowledge and acute reasoning capabilitiesâ€”not repositories of your personal data and NOT some kind of clone of you which somebody by their wisdon think is "better than you" or "more you than you realize yourself".

## The Solution: External Memory You Control

The ancient proverb holds true: **"A broken pencil is better than the most sound mind."** Even AI needs to write things down.

Instead of fighting AI's forgetfulness or paying for proprietary memory systems, we can build a **memory layer** that:
- Works with any LLM (free or paid)
- Keeps you in control of what's remembered
- Helps you organize memories, but is open source so you're free to organize your way.
- Instead of build a "Memory System", we will be asking LLM to do it for us too.

The key insight:

> **Memory isn't about perfect recall or AI "knowing" you. It's about reliable externalize and conveniently retrieval.**

### Core Components

**1. reliable externalization**
- Store texture data as momories.
- Organize memories by tags. Tag memories by project, topic, and any tags of your choice
- Version control everything (it's just text files!)
- **Note:** Windsurf suggested vector embeddings for semantic search. I'm skepticalâ€”convince me with a concrete use case.

**2. conveniently retrieval**
- When you build a prompt, consciously select what memories to include
- Tag memory selections by project for convenience.
- **Note:** Windsurf suggested semantic similarity and prioritizing recent memories. Sounds like something to avoidâ€”we want conscious control, not algorithmic filtering.

**3. Memory Management: The Indirection**
- Review and edit what's stored
- Refactor and reorganize memories as needed
- Question: Are there better tools than LLMs for this?

### Why This Approach Works

âœ… **Free to use** - Works with any LLM, including free ones  
âœ… **LLM-agnostic** - No vendor lock-in. You could send prompts to any expert, human or AI  
âœ… **You stay in control** - Explicitly choose what memories to attach  
âœ… **Transparent** - See and edit what's remembered and what's sent to the LLM. Open source means you can change not just the memory, but how you keep it  
âœ… **Privacy-first** - Your data stays local or in your control  
âœ… **Portable** - Memories are just markdown files  
âœ… **No profiling** - AI doesn't "learn" your style; you consciously add context

## Introducing BrokenPencil: An Open Source Project

I'm building **BrokenPencil** as an open source project on Bitbucket. You enter prompts, get enhanced prompts with selected memories attached, then copy-paste to any LLM website you choose (preferably free).

### Project Goals

**Phase 1: Core Memory System**
- Simple web app to create enhanced prompts
- Basic tagging and organization
- Markdown-based storage for human readability

**Phase 2: Browser Integration**
- Chrome plugin to inject enhanced prompts into LLM websites

**Phase 3: LLM Integration**
- Automatic memory extraction from conversations
- Meta prompts to extract and organize memories
- LLM-assisted refactoring and reorganization

**Phase 4: Advanced Features**
- Scaling intelligence using Agile approach
- Component/service specifications where implementation is hidden from consumers

### Technical Architecture

Windsurf suggested an "impressive" architecture that would probably get budget approval but is way too complex and irrelevant. 

My vetting question for programmers: **"Design the permanent storage mechanism for memories and estimate implementation costs."** 

IMHO, the mechanism is so obvious a qualified programmer should have it at the top of their mind.

### Why Open Source?

1. **No subscription fees** - Free to use, forever
2. **Privacy matters** - You control your memories, not a corporation
3. **Transparency builds trust** - No black boxes
4. **Community innovation** - Better solutions through collaboration
5. **Portability** - No vendor lock-in
6. **Conscious control** - You decide what to use, not an algorithm

## Real-World Use Cases

**Primary Use Case:**
- Stop repeating yourselfâ€”attach relevant context to prompts automatically

**Stretch Goal:**
- Craft prompts that solicit better responses from LLMs
- Challenge: "Better" is relative, especially when free LLM websites add implicit memory that often produces hallucinated responses  

## Current Status & Next Steps

**Current Status:**
- âœ… Project repository created on Bitbucket
- âœ… Architecture design done
- âœ… MVP target: one week
- ðŸ“‹ Make it available to public users

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. Implement basic CLI for manual memory save/retrieve
2. Create simple tagging system
3. Build proof-of-concept web interface
4. Test with real workflows

**Looking for:**
- **Contributors** - Especially those interested in LLM tooling or UX design
- **Feedback** - What features matter most to you?
- **Use cases** - How would you use this in your workflow?

## Join the Project

If you're interested in building better memory systems for AI:

ðŸ”— **Repository:** [Bitbucket - BrokenPencil](https://bitbucket.org/[your-username]/brokenpencil)  
ðŸ“§ **Contact:** [Your Email]  
ðŸ’¬ **Discussion:** Open an issue or start a discussion on the repo

The goal isn't to build the perfect memory systemâ€”it's to build a *good enough* system that's:
- **Reliable** (like a broken pencil that still writes)
- **Transparent** (you can see what's remembered)
- **Controllable** (you decide what matters)
- **Portable** (works with any LLM)

## The Bigger Picture

This project is part of a larger shift in how we interact with AI. Unlike proprietary memory systems, BrokenPencil keeps you in the driver's seat:

- **Stateless interactions** â†’ **Stateful relationships** (you control the state)  
- **One-off queries** â†’ **Ongoing conversations** (with explicit context)  
- **Generic responses** â†’ **Personalized assistance** (through your chosen memories, not AI profiling)  
- **Black box AI** â†’ **Transparent augmentation** (you see what's added)  
- **Paid subscriptions** â†’ **Free, open tools** (works with any LLM)

The broken pencil principle: **External memory you control is better than AI that "knows" you.**

**TL;DR:** AI systems forget because they're stateless. I'm building BrokenPencil, an open source memory layer for LLMs that stores and retrieves context across conversations. It's LLM-agnostic, privacy-first, and transparent. Looking for contributors and feedback.
