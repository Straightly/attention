Windsurf.  Most of them are too good to be removed.  But IMHO, I am not sure they are concrete enough to be implemented.  

### For Developers
- Remember coding preferences and patterns
- Track project-specific conventions
- Maintain context over long projects and into project maintenance

### For Personal Use
- Remember conversations and commitments
- Track learning progress
- Maintain context across different AI tools
- Build a "second brain"

### For Writers
- Keep track of character details and plot points, especially for call backs
- Remember research findings and sources
- Maintain consistent voice and style
- Build a personal knowledge base

### For Teams
- Share project context with new team members
- Document decisions and rationale
- Build institutional knowledge
- Reduce onboarding time

## The Implementation Challenge

Building this isn't just a technical problemâ€”it's a design problem:

**What should be remembered?**
- Not everything is worth saving
- Too much noise drowns out signal
- Users need control over what's stored
- No automatic profiling of "bio, tone, style"

**How should memories be retrieved?**
- Relevance is context-dependent
- Recency vs. importance tradeoff
- **User makes the final decision** on what to attach to prompts
- Balance between convenience and conscious control

**How do we handle conflicts?**
- Preferences change over time
- Information becomes outdated
- Multiple projects have different needs

These are the interesting problems I'm working through in BrokenPencil.

## Current Status & Next Steps

**Current Status:**
- âœ… Project repository created on Bitbucket
- âœ… Architecture design in progress
- ðŸ”„ Core memory storage implementation
- ðŸ“‹ Vector database integration planned

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. Implement basic CLI for manual memory save/retrieve
2. Add semantic search with embeddings
3. Create simple tagging system
4. Build proof-of-concept integration with one AI tool

**Looking for:**
- **Contributors** - Especially those interested in LLM tooling, vector databases, or UX design
- **Feedback** - What features matter most to you?
- **Use cases** - How would you use this in your workflow?

## Join the Project

If you're interested in building better memory systems for AI:

ðŸ”— **Repository:** [Bitbucket - BrokenPencil](https://bitbucket.org/[your-username]/brokenpencil)  
ðŸ“§ **Contact:** [Your Email]  
ðŸ’¬ **Discussion:** Open an issue or start a discussion on the repo

The goal isn't to build the perfect memory systemâ€”it's to build a *good enough* system that's:
- **Reliable** (like a broken pencil that still writes)
- **Transparent** (you can see what's remembered)
- **Controllable** (you decide what matters)
- **Portable** (works with any LLM)

## The Bigger Picture

This project is part of a larger shift in how we interact with AI. But unlike proprietary memory systems, BrokenPencil keeps you in the driver's seat:

**Stateless interactions** â†’ **Stateful relationships** (but you control the state)  
**One-off queries** â†’ **Ongoing conversations** (with explicit context)  
**Generic responses** â†’ **Personalized assistance** (through your chosen memories, not AI profiling)  
**Black box AI** â†’ **Transparent augmentation** (you see what's added to prompts)  
**Paid subscriptions** â†’ **Free, open tools** (works with any LLM)

The broken pencil principle applies: **External memory you control is better than AI that "knows" you.**

## Your Thoughts?

I'd love to hear:
- What memory features would be most valuable to you?
- What concerns do you have about AI memory systems?
- What use cases am I missing?
- Would you use or contribute to something like this?

Drop a comment or reach out directly. Let's build better tools for working with AI.

**TL;DR:** AI systems forget because they're stateless. I'm building BrokenPencil, an open source memory layer for LLMs that stores and retrieves context across conversations. It's LLM-agnostic, privacy-first, and transparent. Looking for contributors and feedback.
