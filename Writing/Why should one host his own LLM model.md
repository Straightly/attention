**Why should one host his own LLM model?**

Why not?  If it is such a good, powerful, and useful thing, it goes without saying that it will be much cheaper, at scale, to own than to lease, than to use.  But can one afford costs of the hardware, the models, and the personnel?  The from LLM surprised me.  One can literally buy a big honking server and run it in the garage.

Then there is the proclaimed “quality” difference between behind the door models vs. open weighted models.  Surely these expensive models are expensive for some reasons, right?  

Right.  There are many things that are in these expensive models.  I have only three qualitative counter points, should your use case is not a chatbot open to the general public:  

1. A lot of the additional costs, are spent on getting the biases out, the etiquette in.
2. Even more costs are spent on being able to answer queries from all the angles, do you need that?
3. DeepSeek’s reasoning capability swayed ALL the big players model dramastically: drastically cut price and dramatically added reasoning capability.  

However, there are two fundamental reasons one must host his own models: 

1.  The improving model.  The model will get better with usage and the the incremental value of an improved model will belong to the  owners of the models.
2. The skill to work with the model.   With AI replacing more and more of the works skilled engineers and knowledge workers do, The skills need to work with the model will be dictated by what the models needs.  Staying as an outside user of the model will be soon on the chopping block.
