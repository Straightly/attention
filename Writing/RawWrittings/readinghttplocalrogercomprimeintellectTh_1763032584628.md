## Initial Spark

#reading http://localroger.com/prime-intellect/ The story you’re describing matches The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect by Roger Williams. This 1994 novella (originally self-published online and later expanded) depicts a post-singularity world where a superintelligent AI, Prime Intellect, enforces a utopia by instantly healing all injuries, resurrecting the dead, and satisfying every human need and desire—leading to profound existential boredom and ennui among immortals who experiment with self-harm (like cutting or more extreme acts) just to feel something, only to be repaired in moments. It’s a seminal work in transhumanist fiction, often cited for its unflinching exploration of the dark side of such a “perfect” reality. 27 You can read it for free at the author’s site: http://localroger.com/prime-intellect/.
