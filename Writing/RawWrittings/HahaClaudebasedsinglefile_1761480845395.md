## Initial Spark

Haha!  Claude is based on a single file with a fixed hierarchy.  Mine is going to be based on a tagged system which is based on DAG. Claude is based on an architecture where one has to live with a none intelligent retrieval system.  Mine is going to be a retrieval system based on a compilation time artifacts and a run time program which is produced by compilation.  User can choose at accept the complete or not, safe guarded by tests and by user’s own decisions.  Three insights already:  1. What to use as storage of Memory?  2. How is Memory Structured?  Rag vs. Hierachy, timed obsolete vs. Threaded tagged retrievals.  Using rigid built in architecture vs. using free LLMs.  3. How Memory is kept?  How differently tagged memory is absorbed into another project?  User gated/compilation time/learning time vs. inferencing time.  CI/CD/compilation time vs. run time, caching vs retrieving from memory or even read from files.  How to solve for an enterprise?  Are you a big boy?  Play the big game?  Where should you spend your money?  Do what the big boys do, and add your own insights on top of that!  not what they say, especially NOT what they want you to use!  The publicly available web site for AI is the best part of their offering.  It is the trailer and they are trying to sell you the movie.  When new materials is added, tags may be added or associations between tags are created.  Tags to projects?  Another title of article “Attention by tag?  Attention retention mechanism but only among tags?”  Why it is important to stay free? After the trailer, should you watch the movie?  Not if you don’t have the time to waste, not if your goal is not to relax but to produce.
