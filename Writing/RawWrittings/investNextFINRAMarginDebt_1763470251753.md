## Initial Spark

#invest Next FINRA Margin Debt Release (as of November 18, 2025)
The most recent available data is for October 2025 (debit balances ~$1.183 trillion, a new record), which was published in the second half of November 2025 (around November 14–18, based on third-party updates like Advisor Perspectives and GuruFocus).
FINRA’s official policy: Margin Statistics are generally published in the third week of the month following the reference month.
	•	The next release will be the November 2025 data.
	•	Expected publication: Third week of December 2025 (typically December 15–19, often a Monday–Wednesday).
	•	Exact date isn’t pre-announced, but it’s almost always mid-to-late in that third week (e.g., Dec 17–18 in recent cycles).
	•	Data appears first on the FINRA website here: https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/key-topics/margin-accounts/margin-statistics (with downloadable Excel).
If the market sell-off continues, the November figure could show the first meaningful deleveraging in months — watch for it around mid-December.
