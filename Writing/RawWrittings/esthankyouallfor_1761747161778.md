## Initial Spark

es, thank you all for the investigation and finding some improvement options! When US monitoring hours take over, I believe Josh Mora can keep a proactive eye on memory usage for the service. The best place I know of for watching that is ECS > medication-benefit-prod cluster > medication-benefit service > "Health and metrics" panel. I will say that as of this moment, the maximum memory utilization is still holding very steady at 118% , which doesn't seem to have come down since the deployment. Motamarri Chandana Venkata Naga Priyanka is this what you expect to see?


4. What Might Help
✅ Task-level auto-scaling based on memory per-task (if supported)
✅ Shorter task lifecycle - Restart tasks proactively every N hours
✅ Circuit breakers - Fail fast on LLM timeouts instead of accumulating
✅ Streaming responses - Don't buffer entire LLM responses in memory
Recommended Next Steps
Capture heap dump when task is about to OOM
Analyze with tools like Eclipse MAT or VisualVM to find leak
Fix the code - likely in LLM client handling
Keep current instance count (8) until leak is fixed
Would you like help analyzing heap dumps or reviewing your LLM client code?
