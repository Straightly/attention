## Initial Spark

Here is the updated table for NVDA’s last 8 completed quarterly earnings reports (prior to today’s Q3 FY2026 report on November 19, 2025). I’ve added three new columns showing the percentage change for the next trading day’s Open, Low, and High relative to the previous day’s close (i.e., the initial overnight/after-hours gap at open, and the intraday extremes).
For NVDA earnings events, the open % change closely reflects the pure after-hours reaction, while the low/high show how far the stock moved intraday before settling at the close.

Additional observations:
	•	The initial open gap (Open %) is usually the most dramatic and directionally predictive of the full-day move.
	•	In negative reaction quarters, the low often extends 2–4% beyond the open gap as selling pressure builds.
	•	In positive quarters, the high frequently pushes 2–5% above the open as buyers step in.
	•	All figures are approximate, post any stock splits, and sourced from historical price data around each earnings event.
This covers the period from late 2023 through mid-2025, capturing the maturing phase of the AI boom where reactions have become more mixed compared to the massive upside gaps seen earlier. Today’s report will add the next data point!

Here is the historical performance of Tesla (TSLA) stock on the trading day immediately following NVIDIA’s quarterly earnings reports (the “morning after” for NVDA, which is the next full trading day after NVDA’s after-hours release). This uses the same 8 recent NVDA quarters as the prior table and measures percentage changes relative to the close before that trading day (i.e., the close on NVDA’s earnings date).
TSLA often moves sympathetically with NVDA on these days due to shared AI/autonomous driving sentiment, but the correlation has weakened in 2025 as Tesla’s performance has been increasingly driven by Robotaxi/FSD/Optimus news and political factors rather than pure AI chip demand.

Minor dip despite NVDA pullback
Key observations for TSLA on these days (last 8 NVDA post-earnings sessions):
	•	Average absolute next-day close move: ~5.1% (smaller than NVDA’s own ~6.0% average in the same period).
	•	Positive days: 4 out of 8; Negative days: 4 out of 8.
	•	Strongest correlation was in late 2023/early 2024 when Tesla was viewed more purely as an “AI play”; recent quarters show more divergence as Tesla’s narrative has shifted toward robotaxis, energy, and non-AI factors.
	•	When NVDA gaps sharply higher (e.g., Feb 2024), TSLA tends to follow aggressively; when NVDA sells off modestly, TSLA sometimes amplifies the downside due to its higher beta/volatility.
All figures are approximate and adjusted for any splits (Tesla had none in this period). Today’s NVDA report (Nov 19, 2025 after close) will produce the next data point for the sequence—TSLA’s reaction tomorrow will depend heavily on NVDA’s tone around inference demand, Blackwell ramp, and any China commentary, alongside any Tesla-specific news flow.
