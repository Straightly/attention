Recommended Paper: “Language Models as Models of Language”
For a PhD program in linguistics (or interdisciplinary linguistics/computational linguistics), a strong example of research combining linguistics and large language models (LLMs) is the paper “Language Models as Models of Language” by Willem Zuidema (2024). This work critically evaluates LLMs not just as engineering tools, but as potential scientific models for understanding human language acquisition, competence, and theoretical linguistics—making it an ideal blueprint for PhD-level inquiry.
Why This Paper Fits as a PhD Research Example
	•	Interdisciplinary Integration: It bridges theoretical linguistics (e.g., debates on syntactic competence, semantic representations like Osgood’s semantic differential, and nativism) with computational methods (e.g., Transformer architectures, causal interventions in LLMs). This mirrors how a PhD could extend your Kinyarwanda conjoint/disjoint alternation work by probing LLMs’ ability to model such phenomena in low-resource Bantu languages.
	•	Research Structure and Rigor:
	◦	Historical/Contextual Review: Starts with an overview of statistical language modeling from information theory to modern LLMs, providing a foundation for lit reviews in a thesis.
	◦	Methodological Innovation: Proposes experiments using controlled learning conditions and causal interventions (e.g., editing model weights to test hypotheses on acquisition), which could inspire empirical chapters in a PhD—such as fine-tuning LLMs on Kinyarwanda data to simulate syntactic alternations.
	◦	Theoretical Contributions: Challenges critiques of connectionist models (e.g., as mere “statistical approximations”) and argues for LLMs’ role in constraining linguistic theories, like testing innatism vs. emergentism.
	◦	Future Directions: Calls for collaboration between linguists and computational researchers, offering hooks for proposal extensions (e.g., applying to prosody-syntax interfaces in Bantu).
	•	PhD-Relevant Scope: At ~20 pages (arXiv preprint), it’s concise yet deep, suitable for a dissertation chapter or pilot study. It emphasizes ethical/data-driven approaches, aligning with low-resource language challenges (e.g., adapting LLMs to underrepresented languages like Kinyarwanda).
	•	Impact and Accessibility: Published on arXiv (open-access), it’s citable in proposals and has implications for fields like psycholinguistics or NLP, potentially leading to publications in journals like Computational Linguistics.
How to Use It in Your PhD
	•	As a Model Proposal: Frame your research question around “Can LLMs model the conjoint/disjoint alternation in Kinyarwanda as a proxy for human syntactic competence?”—echoing Zuidema’s focus on LLMs as testable hypotheses.
	•	Methodological Adaptation: Replicate its causal intervention experiments on LLMs (e.g., via Hugging Face) with Kinyarwanda corpora, combining linguistic elicitation with computational probing.
	•	Extensions: Build on its call for collaboration by partnering with NLP experts to address biases in low-resource training data.

This paper exemplifies how linguistics can drive LLM research toward deeper theoretical insights, rather than just applications—perfect for a PhD aiming to innovate at their intersection. If you’d like alternatives (e.g., on low-resource languages) or help adapting it to your topic, let me know!
