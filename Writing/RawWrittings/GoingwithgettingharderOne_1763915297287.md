## Initial Spark

Going with AI is getting harder.  One main challenge was to adopt the fast changing technology.  The changes are very fast.

To start with, I have 9 chatbot on my iPhone which I put in an icon box without splitting to two pages and made a resolution that I will not add any more.  In case a new one come out that I have to try, I will remove one first, what ever cache eviction policy I choose at that time!

Next level of tool one has to choose are the IDEs.  I have been using Windsurf for the last few months.  It had been great, so great indeed that after use the enterprise version at work and achieved 98% of code written by Windsurf across 4 languages, I have only 2% of a reason to try new ones.

One thing missing is it cannot manage two projects together if one is local while another is remote.  When Antigravity came out, claiming multiple agent support, I could not resist but give it a try.

It did not work well at all.  The interaction view it has is identical to Windsurf, but the interaction, probably tried to go parallel prematurely, tangled things up a lot.  But the one thing that made it intolerable and made me switching back was the fact that it cannot edit or change a file without totally messing up.  The weird thing was, it could, after it messed up, offer to complete rewrite the file, does not matter if the file is my journal of prompt, my project plan, or a code file.  For almost all the cases, it actually did a good job at the second try, until it break my app’s login flow.

I did not get close to its advanced features of multiple agents.

This leads me to think what stayed with my experiences experimenting with vibe programming.  

1. Git.  Cannot imagine I dit not use git.
2 divide and conquer.  One HAS to break tasks small enough so AI can do it and one can verify that AI did it.  
3 divide and conquer does not have to be bottom up or top down.  Many times, it is necessary to have something that is partially working and then change.  But make sure it is verified.  This is where Antigravity was brought down to earth:  it does not seem to understand the structure of the code, even the code it wrote itself to localize the changes.  
4. How do I know my tasks are divided well and are small enough?  Well, try it out and make sure your working code has been checked in before you do it.  I was surprised often by what Windsurf can and cannot do.
