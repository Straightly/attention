## Initial Spark

Found out it has a time of art activity and it triggered me an investigation of time and duration (derivatives) and duration in general and duration starting at a fixed time. It will be interesting to see what measurement of time is all about.

## Key Concepts

- Time in art
- Duration and its derivatives
- Duration in general vs. duration starting at a fixed time
- Measurement of time

## Questions to Explore

- What does "time of art activity" mean in the museum context?
- How do we measure and perceive duration differently in art vs. physics?
- What is the relationship between fixed-time duration and open-ended duration?

## Potential Connections

- Philosophy of time
- Phenomenology of art experience
- Physics and temporal measurement

## Next Steps

- Visit the museum and observe the "time of art activity"
- Research philosophical perspectives on time and duration
- Consider how this relates to other writings on perception and experience
