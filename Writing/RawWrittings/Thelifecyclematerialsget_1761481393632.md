## Initial Spark

The life cycle:  materials get tagged.  Tags get associated.  Associated tags get assigned to projects and get used.  When new tags are created, they may get assigned to projects that are active, or even activate existing but old projects.  Better than time based retrieval.  Materials get refactored and re-organized.  New index gets created and old one removed? Removal can be made consciously.  Tags can have descriptions which is critical in creating associations.  Like linking diagnoses to medications to labs to problems.
