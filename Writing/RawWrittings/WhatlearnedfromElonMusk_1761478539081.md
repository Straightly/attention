## Initial Spark

What I learned from Elon Musk?  Why shoot for the Moon, if you can shoot for the Mars?  He shoot for a EV that is better than an ICE and was successful.  He shoot for the Mars and was successful to the degree that he succeeded to monopolized space launches.  Except China, that is.  China is saying to Elon Musk: Dare you.  Elon Musk is more than willing to conform.  If he can contoured to Trump, there is not much he cannot contour for.
