- Building a customer-facing decision support system for providers using LLMs.
  - Implementing a "Small Agent Model" that can be injected into workflows so that:
    - PHI data is isolated from the public LLM boundary.
    - Workflow context is automatically collected and formatted into prompts, reducing provider effort and improving accuracy.
    - Resource limits are balanced against prompt and response sizes while filling care gaps.
    - Recommended actions are automated to save provider time.
    - Provider feedback is captured to build datasets for validation and (future) LLM fine-tuning.
- Researched and proposed a technology modernization plan to move Med Zone beyond a legacy Perl-based system.
- Designed and implemented Medication History download improvements to reduce information overload by filtering data before it enters the chart; contributed to broader interoperability architecture.

### Senior Staff Software Engineer — GE Healthcare
*July 2016 – December 2022*

- Led delivery of an Azure-based service integrated into a legacy GEHC frontend to surface real-time medication information to doctors.
