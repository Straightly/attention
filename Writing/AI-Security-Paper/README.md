# AI Agent Security Paper

## Overview
This folder contains a research paper on the security of AI agents, focusing on authentication and authorization challenges when agents retrieve confidential information and invoke privileged actions.

## Paper Structure

### Main Document
- **AI-Agent-Security-Authentication-Authorization.md** - Main paper draft

### References Folder
Contains your original notes and ideas that inform the paper:
- `Id for an agent and the Ying and Yang of Security.md` - Core concepts on Yin/Yang of security
- `InfoSec.md` - Notes on two-legged vs three-legged tokens
- `Agent-Service-Account-Note.md` - Critical insights on agent identity and service accounts

## Key Concepts

### Core Thesis
AI agents must be treated as services that operate under delegated human authority, not as independent entities with their own credentials.

### Main Arguments
1. **Agents are services, not users** - They need service-like security with human accountability
2. **Two-legged tokens are insufficient** - Create security gaps for autonomous agents
3. **Chain of trust is essential** - Every action must trace back to authenticated humans
4. **Three-legged authentication required** - User → Agent → Resource

### The Yin and Yang Framework
- **Yang (Use of Privileges):** Active enforcement of boundaries
- **Yin (Granting of Authority):** Foundational control of what privileges exist

## Current Status

### Completed
- ✅ Abstract and introduction
- ✅ Core conceptual framework
- ✅ Yin and Yang security model
- ✅ Fundamental principles
- ✅ Chain of trust proposal
- ✅ Security boundaries discussion

### TODO
- ⏳ Literature review (Section 2)
- ⏳ Detailed Auth0 protocol analysis (Section 6)
- ⏳ Agent operation protocols (Section 7)
- ⏳ Case studies (Section 9)
- ⏳ Implementation challenges (Section 10)
- ⏳ Architecture diagrams
- ⏳ Code examples

## Next Steps

1. **Research Phase**
   - Review Auth0 documentation for protocol details
   - Research existing AI agent security frameworks
   - Find case studies and real-world examples

2. **Technical Development**
   - Create detailed authentication flow diagrams
   - Write protocol specifications for agent operations
   - Develop code examples for Auth0 integration

3. **Case Studies**
   - Email management agent
   - Financial transaction agent
   - Healthcare data agent

4. **Polish**
   - Add formal references
   - Create diagrams and figures
   - Expand implementation sections
   - Proofread and refine

## Target
- **Length:** 8,000-10,000 words
- **Current:** ~2,500 words
- **Audience:** Security researchers, AI practitioners, system architects
