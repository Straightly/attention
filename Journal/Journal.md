# October 17, 2025 — Created Code Snippets Template

Created a reusable template for documenting useful commands and code snippets in `Writing/Codesnipts/`. The template includes sections for description, command/code, notes, examples, and tags. Applied it to document the P4 toggle command (`set-toggle.md`).

# June 11, 2025 — How deep is your AI strategy?

Add your notes here…

**AI is everywhere, and conventional wisdom says you're falling behind if you're not using it.**

Naturally, many flock to ChatGPT, impressed by its knowledge and comprehension, and occasionally chuckled at its hallucinations.

As a software developer or organization building applications, what's your AI strategy? The conventional path seems clear: begin with ChatGPT, progress to frameworks like LangChain for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and ultimately develop sophisticated pipelines and agentic AI.

But here's the contradiction: the right way to use AI as a software developer should be using fine-tuning to improve on the models themselves.

RAG works by indexing external knowledge into vector databases and adding retrieved snippets to prompts—essentially giving the LLM a cheat sheet for each response. This approach has fundamental limitations: LLMs don't actually "learn" from these snippets; they merely reference them temporarily. The result? Inconsistent outputs and unnecessary system complexity.  LLM is literally one step removed for this corps of knowledge.

If you possess specialized data or domain knowledge, why compromise with this halfway measure? Instead of patching a base LLM with external retrieval, **fine-tune the model directly on your data**. Fine-tuning weaves your knowledge into the model's parameters, creating an inherently more intelligent and reliable solution for your specific needs.

Yes, RAG's popularity stems from its quick implementation and lack of costly retraining. But it's merely a temporary fix, not a lasting solution. Fine-tuning offers the true path to AI that deeply understands your domain, produces reliable results, and scales effectively.

**In short:**

Don't fall for the trend of layering retrieval onto base models. If you want AI that truly serves your users, make fine-tuning your primary strategy—not just an afterthought.

What's your perspective? Are you still depending on RAG, or have you embraced fine-tuning as the way forward?

**一、PCI术后用药的重要性**

经皮冠状动脉介入治疗（PCI，即心脏支架手术）后，规范的药物治疗是预防支架内血栓、再狭窄及控制动脉粥样硬化进展的关键。患者需长期坚持用药，以降低心血管事件复发风险，保护心脏功能。

**二、术后常用药物及注意事项**

**1. 抗血小板药物**

**常用药物：**阿司匹林、氯吡格雷、替格瑞洛等。

**作用：**防止支架内血栓形成，需联合使用至少1年（具体遵医嘱）。

**注意事项：**

- 严格遵医嘱服药，不可自行停药或调整剂量。
- 观察出血倾向（如牙龈出血、鼻出血、黑便等），轻微出血可咨询医生，严重出血需立即就医。
- 避免同时服用非甾体抗炎药（如布洛芬），可能增加出血风险。

**2. 他汀类药物**

**常用药物：**阿托伐他汀、瑞舒伐他汀等。

**作用：**降低胆固醇、稳定动脉斑块，需长期服用。

**注意事项：**

- 定期复查肝功能（每3~6个月）和肌酸激酶（CK），若出现肌肉酸痛、乏力需及时就诊。
- 避免大量食用西柚或饮用西柚汁，可能影响药物代谢。

**3. 降压药与降糖药**

**目标：**控制血压（＜140/90 mmHg）和血糖（空腹血糖≤7.0 mmol/L），降低心脏负荷。

**注意事项：**

- 每日监测血压、血糖，记录并复诊时携带数据。
- 不可因指标正常自行减药或停药。

**4. 其他药物**

- β受体阻滞剂（如美托洛尔）：减慢心率，减轻心脏耗氧。
- ACEI/ARB类药物（如培哚普利、缬沙坦）：保护心脏功能，改善预后。

**三、用药护理要点**

**1. 规律服药，避免漏服**

- 设定每日固定服药时间，使用分药盒或手机提醒辅助记忆。
- 若漏服，切勿加倍补服，需咨询医生或药师。

**2. 警惕药物相互作用**

- 就诊时需告知医生正在服用的所有药物（包括中药、保健品），避免与抗血小板药物冲突。

**3. 饮食与药物配合**

- 阿司匹林建议餐后服用以减少胃肠道刺激。
- 服用他汀类药物期间避免饮酒，防止肝损伤。

**四、自我监测与复诊**

**1. 定期复查：**术后1个月、3个月、6个月及每年需复查血常规、肝肾功能、血脂、心电图等。

**2. 症状观察：**若出现胸痛、胸闷、气促加重或持续不缓解，立即就医。

**3. 药物调整：**切勿自行换药，复诊时由医生根据检查结果调整方案。

**五、健康生活方式配合**

- 戒烟限酒：吸烟会加速血栓形成，酒精可能影响药物疗效。
- 合理饮食：低盐、低脂、高纤维，控制总热量。
- 适度运动：在医生指导下进行有氧运动（如步行、慢跑），避免剧烈活动。

**六、特别提醒**

抗血小板药物需长期服用：即使无不适，擅自停药可能导致支架内血栓，引发心梗甚至猝死！

出血与血栓的平衡：若需拔牙、手术或胃镜检查，需提前告知医生正在服用抗血小板药物。

PCI术后的规范用药是守护心脏健康的“生命线”。请牢记“按时、按量、长期坚持”的原则，配合健康生活方式和定期复诊，才能最大程度降低疾病复发风险，重获健康生活！

# May 13, 2025 — today’s 11.5 miles was better than recent runs.  Feeling that I was improving.

---

Today, ran to the turning point of the 5k race SU is organizing.  It was about 10 min per mile to and 9 min per mile back.  I wore the Xtep regular and it felt rather sitting back.

Joy returned home.  She immediately got quite allergic to cat hairs.  Had to vacuum her room.
