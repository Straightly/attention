# June 11, 2025 — How deep is your AI strategy?

Add your notes here…

**AI is everywhere, and conventional wisdom says you're falling behind if you're not using it.**

Naturally, many flock to ChatGPT, impressed by its knowledge and comprehension, and occasionally chuckled at its hallucinations.

As a software developer or organization building applications, what's your AI strategy? The conventional path seems clear: begin with ChatGPT, progress to frameworks like LangChain for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and ultimately develop sophisticated pipelines and agentic AI.

But here's the contradiction: the right way to use AI as a software developer should be using fine-tuning to improve on the models themselves.

RAG works by indexing external knowledge into vector databases and adding retrieved snippets to prompts—essentially giving the LLM a cheat sheet for each response. This approach has fundamental limitations: LLMs don't actually "learn" from these snippets; they merely reference them temporarily. The result? Inconsistent outputs and unnecessary system complexity.  LLM is literally one step removed for this corps of knowledge.

If you possess specialized data or domain knowledge, why compromise with this halfway measure? Instead of patching a base LLM with external retrieval, **fine-tune the model directly on your data**. Fine-tuning weaves your knowledge into the model's parameters, creating an inherently more intelligent and reliable solution for your specific needs.

Yes, RAG's popularity stems from its quick implementation and lack of costly retraining. But it's merely a temporary fix, not a lasting solution. Fine-tuning offers the true path to AI that deeply understands your domain, produces reliable results, and scales effectively.

**In short:**

Don't fall for the trend of layering retrieval onto base models. If you want AI that truly serves your users, make fine-tuning your primary strategy—not just an afterthought.

What's your perspective? Are you still depending on RAG, or have you embraced fine-tuning as the way forward?

**一、PCI术后用药的重要性**

经皮冠状动脉介入治疗（PCI，即心脏支架手术）后，规范的药物治疗是预防支架内血栓、再狭窄及控制动脉粥样硬化进展的关键。患者需长期坚持用药，以降低心血管事件复发风险，保护心脏功能。

**二、术后常用药物及注意事项**

**1. 抗血小板药物**

**常用药物：**阿司匹林、氯吡格雷、替格瑞洛等。

**作用：**防止支架内血栓形成，需联合使用至少1年（具体遵医嘱）。

**注意事项：**

- 严格遵医嘱服药，不可自行停药或调整剂量。
- 观察出血倾向（如牙龈出血、鼻出血、黑便等），轻微出血可咨询医生，严重出血需立即就医。
- 避免同时服用非甾体抗炎药（如布洛芬），可能增加出血风险。

**2. 他汀类药物**

**常用药物：**阿托伐他汀、瑞舒伐他汀等。

**作用：**降低胆固醇、稳定动脉斑块，需长期服用。

**注意事项：**

- 定期复查肝功能（每3~6个月）和肌酸激酶（CK），若出现肌肉酸痛、乏力需及时就诊。
- 避免大量食用西柚或饮用西柚汁，可能影响药物代谢。

**3. 降压药与降糖药**

**目标：**控制血压（＜140/90 mmHg）和血糖（空腹血糖≤7.0 mmol/L），降低心脏负荷。

**注意事项：**

- 每日监测血压、血糖，记录并复诊时携带数据。
- 不可因指标正常自行减药或停药。

**4. 其他药物**

- β受体阻滞剂（如美托洛尔）：减慢心率，减轻心脏耗氧。
- ACEI/ARB类药物（如培哚普利、缬沙坦）：保护心脏功能，改善预后。

**三、用药护理要点**

**1. 规律服药，避免漏服**

- 设定每日固定服药时间，使用分药盒或手机提醒辅助记忆。
- 若漏服，切勿加倍补服，需咨询医生或药师。

**2. 警惕药物相互作用**

- 就诊时需告知医生正在服用的所有药物（包括中药、保健品），避免与抗血小板药物冲突。

**3. 饮食与药物配合**

- 阿司匹林建议餐后服用以减少胃肠道刺激。
- 服用他汀类药物期间避免饮酒，防止肝损伤。

**四、自我监测与复诊**

**1. 定期复查：**术后1个月、3个月、6个月及每年需复查血常规、肝肾功能、血脂、心电图等。

**2. 症状观察：**若出现胸痛、胸闷、气促加重或持续不缓解，立即就医。

**3. 药物调整：**切勿自行换药，复诊时由医生根据检查结果调整方案。

**五、健康生活方式配合**

- 戒烟限酒：吸烟会加速血栓形成，酒精可能影响药物疗效。
- 合理饮食：低盐、低脂、高纤维，控制总热量。
- 适度运动：在医生指导下进行有氧运动（如步行、慢跑），避免剧烈活动。

**六、特别提醒**

抗血小板药物需长期服用：即使无不适，擅自停药可能导致支架内血栓，引发心梗甚至猝死！

出血与血栓的平衡：若需拔牙、手术或胃镜检查，需提前告知医生正在服用抗血小板药物。

PCI术后的规范用药是守护心脏健康的“生命线”。请牢记“按时、按量、长期坚持”的原则，配合健康生活方式和定期复诊，才能最大程度降低疾病复发风险，重获健康生活！

# May 13, 2025 — today’s 11.5 miles was better than recent runs.  Feeling that I was improving.

---

Today, ran to the turning point of the 5k race SU is organizing.  It was about 10 min per mile to and 9 min per mile back.  I wore the Xtep regular and it felt rather sitting back.

Joy returned home.  She immediately got quite allergic to cat hairs.  Had to vacuum her room.

# November 13, 2025 — Markdown Syntax Overview

**Prompt (10:20):** Can you give me a very quick overview of mark down file tag usage?

**Action:** Provided comprehensive Markdown syntax reference covering headers, text formatting, lists, links/images, code blocks, quotes, tables, and task lists.

---

# November 13, 2025 — Prompt Journaling Clarification

**Prompt (10:24):** did you journal my prompts?

**Action:** Explained that prompts are not automatically journaled. Described memory system capabilities and offered to create journal entries if requested.

---

# November 13, 2025 — Journal Location Correction

**Prompt (10:25):** I have been journal all my prompts in this project. Please check and continue the practice.

**Action:** Initially found `Writing/Vibe-Programming/ToDoAppPrompts.md` and added entries there. User corrected that all journaling should be in `Journal/Journal.md` at project root.

**Prompt (10:27):** No. I have been journal everything in this project rooted at root of this Windsurf project at Journal/Journal.md

**Action:** Corrected to use the proper journal file at `/Users/zan/z/attention/Journal/Journal.md`. Will continue documenting all prompts here going forward.

# November 13, 2025 — iPhone App Development Time Estimate

**Prompt (16:41):** Please remember to journal my prompts. Now, if I want to wrap my ToDoApp as an iPhone app, for a very experience developer with no iPhone app nor XCode experiences, how long will it take in man hours including learning curve?

**Action:** Provided detailed time estimate for wrapping ToDoApp as iPhone app for experienced developer new to iOS/Xcode. Broke down learning curve and implementation phases with hour estimates.

**Prompt (16:46):** Will using Windsurf to write all my code help? I have been using Windsurf for 98% for my coding.

**Action:** Analyzed how Windsurf/AI coding assistants impact iOS development timeline for first-time iOS developers. Estimated 15-25 hours with Windsurf, or 12-18 hours using Capacitor + Windsurf approach.

**Prompt (16:50):** Sounds great. Lets start. Please take this approach and give me step by step instructions, maybe start by creating a folder called iPhoneApp and create a projectPlan.md there so I can keep track of progress.

**Action:** Created iPhoneApp folder with comprehensive projectPlan.md containing step-by-step instructions for wrapping ToDoApp as iPhone app using Capacitor approach.

**Prompt (16:53):** Give me detailed instruction to install XCode. I use brew but that may not be relevant.

**Action:** Provided detailed Xcode installation instructions including both Mac App Store and Homebrew Cask methods, with verification steps and troubleshooting.

**Prompt (16:54):** Before I start, can you add the time estimates to my project plan? I will add the real time spent when I finish them so I can track.

**Action:** Updated projectPlan.md to add time estimates for each step and a time tracking section for actual vs estimated comparison.

**Prompt (16:59):** When I search for Xcode, I notice there is an Apple Developer. I assume, for my purpose, I will not need that, right?

**Action:** Clarified that "Apple Developer" app is different from Xcode. User needs Xcode (blue hammer icon), not Apple Developer app (red icon for managing App Store submissions).

**Prompt (17:03):** To make the app run on my own phone, I do not need App Developer, right?

**Action:** Confirmed that Apple Developer app is NOT needed to run on own phone. Only need: Xcode + free Apple ID account (add in Xcode preferences). No paid developer account or Apple Developer app required for personal device testing.

**Prompt (17:05):** Will the app continue to run after I un-tetherd my phone from my dev XCode?

**Action:** Explained that yes, app runs independently after deployment. With free Apple ID, app works for 7 days untethered, then needs re-deployment. With paid developer account ($99/year), app works for 1 year between re-deployments.

**Prompt (17:08):** I do not plan to ever do new development in XCode. My plan is to make change in my ToDoApp hosted in github, and port the change, as automatically as possible to the iPhone app. Will this setup you recommended work well for my intention?

**Action:** Confirmed Capacitor approach is perfect for this workflow. Changes to HTML/CSS/JS are automatically picked up. Workflow: 1) Edit ToDoApp code, 2) Run `npx cap sync`, 3) Deploy from Xcode (no Xcode editing needed). Can create script to automate sync step.

**Prompt (17:10):** No. That was my local deployed copy I made for demo purpose. My real version is in ToDoApp which is hosted on GitHub and docs folder in my project. Please correct your memory.

**Action:** Corrected understanding: Real ToDoApp is in `/Users/zan/z/attention/docs/` folder (GitHub Pages deployment), NOT the localhost:3000 server version. The iPhone app should wrap the GitHub-hosted web version that uses GitHub API with token authentication, not the local Bitbucket server version.

**Prompt (17:11):** Please update my project plan accordingly.

**Action:** Updated projectPlan.md to reflect correct ToDoApp structure: development in ToDoApp/, production in docs/, uses GitHub API (not localhost server), simplified Phase 3 since no server adaptation needed.

**Prompt (17:55):** Xcode is downloaded and installed.

**Action:** Confirmed Step 1.1 complete. Guiding user to verify installation and proceed to Step 1.2 (CocoaPods) and Step 1.3 (Capacitor CLI).

**Prompt (18:43):** Was having trouble install ERROR: Error installing cocoapods: The last version of activesupport (>= 5.0, < 8) to support your Ruby & RubyGems was 6.1.7.10. Try installing it with `gem install activesupport -v 6.1.7.10` and then running the current command again activesupport requires Ruby version >= 3.1.0. The current ruby version is 2.6.10.210. It has run into similar errors three times already with each time it ask me to install something else after a long time.

**Action:** Identified Ruby version issue (2.6.10 too old, needs >= 3.1.0). Recommended using Homebrew to install modern Ruby, then install CocoaPods. Alternative: skip CocoaPods for now since Capacitor can handle iOS dependencies.

**Prompt (18:50):** That was successful. What's next?

**Action:** Ruby 3.4.7 installed successfully via Homebrew. Now updating PATH, verifying Ruby version, and installing CocoaPods to complete Phase 1.

**Prompt (18:53):** It is done.

**Action:** Phase 1 complete (Xcode, Ruby, CocoaPods, Capacitor all installed). Starting Phase 2: initializing Capacitor project, creating config, and copying ToDoApp files.

**Prompt (19:02):** Got Communication with Apple failed. Your team has no devices from which to generate a provisioning profile. Connect a device to use or manually add device IDs in Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles. https://developer.apple.com/account/

**Action:** Provisioning profile error - need to either connect physical iPhone or switch to simulator-only testing. Guiding user to change signing settings to allow simulator testing without device registration.

**Prompt (19:04):** My iPhone is connected. I also see another error No profiles for 'com.attention.todoapp' were found. Xcode couldn't find any iOS App Development provisioning profiles matching 'com.attention.todoapp'.

**Action:** iPhone connected but provisioning profile not auto-generated. Guiding user to: 1) Verify Apple ID is added in Xcode, 2) Ensure "Automatically manage signing" is checked, 3) Trust device on iPhone, 4) Let Xcode regenerate profile.

**Prompt (19:33):** That did not work. I have to search on the internet. It turned out one has to enable Developer mode on the iPhone and then register the device in XCode. and Then select the device in a field on top of the XCode. Now it a profile is provisioned saying "Apple Development: zhian.job@gmail.com (...)". What to do next?

**Action:** User successfully enabled Developer Mode on iPhone and provisioning profile is now working. Ready to build and run app on physical device. Guiding to click Play button to deploy.

**Prompt (19:43):** Has to trust my developer's cert on my device. Now the app is working.

**Action:** SUCCESS! iPhone app is running on physical device. User completed Phases 1-4: environment setup, project creation, iOS platform initialization, and deployment. App successfully wraps GitHub Pages ToDoApp with GitHub API integration. Ready for Phase 5 (polish) or can start using immediately.

**Prompt (19:45):** Can you please add the "Updating Your App" instructions to README.md?

**Action:** Creating comprehensive README.md in iPhoneApp folder with setup summary, update workflow, troubleshooting, and important notes about 7-day expiration.

**Prompt (19:51):** Can you add an .gitignore in folder iPhoneApp to ignore the node_modules?

**Action:** Creating .gitignore in iPhoneApp folder to ignore node_modules, iOS build artifacts, and other generated files that shouldn't be committed to git.

**Prompt (19:56):** Please update iPhoneApp/projectPlan.md

**Action:** Updating projectPlan.md to mark Phases 1-4 as complete, add completion notes, and document the successful deployment to iPhone.

**Prompt (20:19):** I want to replace the default icon of the iPhone app. I have the image at iPhoneApp/icon.png

**Action:** Helping user replace default app icon. Need to generate multiple icon sizes (1024x1024 for App Store, plus various sizes for iOS) and update Xcode asset catalog. Created generate-icons.sh script using sips to create all required iOS icon sizes from source image, updated Contents.json, and synced with Capacitor.

**Prompt (07:52, Nov 14):** Please edit this so I can send it to my colleagues. A follow up update: Yesterday evening, I was able to make my todo App an iPhone app. I had no experiences writing iPhone apps and do not know any of iPhone dev languages or envs. Windsurf estimated 50-60 hrs originally. After back and forth with options, we end up with a plan with about 20hrs. In the end, we did in about 3 hrs. In the middle, I found something Windsurf was not able to do: I had to ask ChatGPT and then google some errors trying to hook up my phone to XCode, enable my phone for dev mode, and allow my phone to accept application from my iPhone developer account. If it were not for that, it would have been done in less than 2hrs. If Windsurf is sentient, it would be surprised itself.

**Action:** Created professional colleague update message documenting the iPhone app development experience: no prior iOS experience, 50-60hr initial estimate → 20hr revised → 3hr actual completion. Highlighted AI's strengths (code/config) and limitations (platform-specific device setup). Message emphasizes the gap where manual intervention was needed for Xcode/iPhone connection.

**Prompt (07:54):** Please journal my prompts. Please also add this to my Vibe Programming articles.

**Action:** Journaling prompts and creating comprehensive Vibe Programming article about iPhone app development experience with AI assistance.

# November 14, 2025 — Time Zone Conversions

**Prompt (14:19):** What time is 20:00 PST time on Monday 11/24/2025 in India?

**Action:** Calculated 20:00 PST = 09:30 IST (Tuesday, Nov 25). India is 13.5 hours ahead of PST.

**Prompt (14:40):** What time is 21:00 PST time on Monday 11/24/2025 in India?

**Action:** Calculated 21:00 PST = 10:30 IST (Tuesday, Nov 25).

# November 14, 2025 — Email Editing for Bela

**Prompt (15:22):** Please edit "Hi Bela, With the rapid advances in AI, I've been exploring opportunities where I can contribute more directly to this space. I started my career with a Ph.D. in artificial intelligence and have become a very experienced full software developer. Both Heather Lane and Ahmer Khan (my boss) suggested I reach out to you, as you might be looking for helps with my background. I'd love to learn about any opportunities in your organization and share my background and experience with you. I wanted to schedule a short meeting with you but could not find any empty slot in your schedule. Do you mind finding some time to chat? Thanks, Z"

**Action:** Edited message for professionalism: changed "full software developer" to "full-stack", "my boss" to "my manager", "looking for helps" to "have opportunities that align", improved phrasing throughout.

# November 15, 2025 — ToDoApp Security Discussion

**Prompt (20:05):** I have a question of security of my ToAoApp. I understand that I need to enter and save that token in my browser. I wonder what if I want to add another layer of security where the user must be authentication to Google and the username (google email adress) must match a list of usernames? Is that possible with my app hosted in github? How does that work?

**Action:** Explained two approaches: (1) Client-side Google OAuth with allowlist (simpler, less secure), (2) Backend service with private allowlist (more secure). Discussed implementation options.

**Prompt (20:11):** Time wise, how long will it take me to create, deploy an authenticate service as AWS lambda, what kind of free access one can have on it?

**Action:** Provided AWS Lambda timeline (2-3 hours) and free tier details (1M requests/month, 400K GB-seconds). Recommended Cloudflare Workers as easier alternative (1-1.5 hours, 100K requests/day free).

**Prompt (20:15):** WIll it make sense to host my whole app in Cloudflare, then, as using the github token was kind of hack to start with.

**Action:** Recommended migrating entire ToDoApp to Cloudflare Pages + Workers for better security (no exposed tokens), proper authentication, and real database. Estimated 4-6 hours (3-4 with Windsurf).

**Prompt (20:18):** No. I have a new app in mind. Please create a folder under the project root called PaceLeader. And create an WebApp under it with Google authentication. Right now it does nothing other than provide a login page which I will deploy to Cloudflare to verify the setup.

**Action:** Created PaceLeader web app with Google OAuth authentication: index.html (login UI), app.js (OAuth logic), README.md (setup guide), and .gitignore. Ready for Cloudflare Pages deployment.

**Prompt (20:22):** Please add all the prompts to my journal. After you done with that, create a project plan for PaceLeader and save it under PaceLeader with time estimate.

**Action:** Added all session prompts to journal and created comprehensive PaceLeader project plan (PROJECT_PLAN.md) with 6 phases, time estimates (13-18 hours total), technology stack, risk assessment, and time tracking table.

**Prompt (20:29):** For a hosted app on Cloudflare, one one have some storage for free? Just some text file seemed to be sufficent.

**Action:** Explained Cloudflare's free storage options: KV (1GB, 100K reads/day, 1K writes/day), D1 (5GB, 5M reads/day), and R2 (10GB). Recommended KV for simple text storage.

**Prompt (20:31):** WOW, that is a lot of space for free forever. Hope Cloudflare will never go bankrupt.

**Action:** Explained Cloudflare's financial strength ($1.6B revenue, $30B market cap, profitable, powers 20% of websites). Discussed why generous free tiers are sustainable business model and suggested backup strategies.

**Prompt (20:33):** Give me detail direction on obtain Google OAuth id.

**Action:** Provided comprehensive step-by-step guide for obtaining Google OAuth Client ID: creating Google Cloud project, enabling Google+ API, configuring OAuth consent screen, creating credentials, and testing locally.

**Prompt (20:36):** This is free from Google, right?

**Action:** Confirmed Google OAuth is 100% free forever with no rate limits, no per-user charges, and no credit card required. Explained why Google offers it free (ecosystem lock-in, competition with other identity providers).

**Prompt (20:37):** Did you logged all my prompts?

**Action:** Logged all recent prompts to journal.

# November 15, 2025 — PaceLeader Google OAuth Setup & Troubleshooting

**Prompt (21:02):** In step 8 test locally, got a dialog from google saying sign in to localhost with google.com, Can't continue with google.com. Someting went wrong. It has only one button says "Got it"

**Action:** Diagnosed OAuth consent screen issue. Provided instructions to add test users to OAuth consent screen or publish the app to allow any Google user to sign in.

**Prompt (21:11):** I publish the app, but got the same error.

**Action:** Identified likely issue with Authorized JavaScript origins not configured correctly. Provided steps to verify and add `http://localhost:8000` to authorized origins in Google Cloud Console. Suggested checking browser console for specific error messages.

**Prompt (21:14):** how to clear cache or use incognito mode?

**Action:** Provided instructions for clearing browser cache (Cmd+Shift+Delete) and using incognito/private mode across different browsers (Chrome: Cmd+Shift+N, Safari: Cmd+Shift+N, Firefox: Cmd+Shift+P, Edge: Cmd+Shift+N).

**Prompt (21:26):** In ignito window, click on "Sign in with Google" deos notthing. Clear cache etc leads to exact same error. Also, when I try to login, a dialog will come up and say "google will share name etc with this site and a continue button. The error happen when I client on the continue button. It almost seemed that google was expecting a forwarding page but was missing that. Can you check our app to see if Google web api now expected a forward url or something like that and it is missing?

**Action:** Identified root cause: code was using `google.accounts.id.prompt()` (One Tap flow) which requires redirect URIs. Fixed by changing to `google.accounts.id.renderButton()` which uses popup flow without redirect URIs. Updated app.js to render Google's official sign-in button and handle sign-in/sign-out properly.

**Prompt (21:27):** Please add all my prompts!

**Action:** Added all OAuth troubleshooting prompts to journal.

**Prompt (21:28):** Please remember to add my prompts from now on.

**Action:** Confirmed will journal all prompts going forward automatically.

**Prompt (21:29):** Now it worked. I will resume working on this later.

**Action:** Confirmed Google OAuth sign-in is now working locally. PaceLeader Phase 1 local testing complete. User will continue deployment to Cloudflare Pages later.

The function I want for authorization is this:  I will maintain three user list, one for admins, one for pacers and one for runners.  They should be all google account user name.  When a user login through google, the username will be checked again all three lists.  If no match found,  tell user to "To be admitted, please consult SU WeChat group to sign up."  If the name is found in one list, show a page showing a page says "you are signed up as a [admin|pacer|runner]" accordingly.  If the name is found in more than one list, show a page where the user can choose the role he wanted to sign in and then show the "you are signed in..." page.  The admin list should contain zhian.job to start with.  The other two contain zhian.job and jianame.  Please adjust the project plan accordingly first.
