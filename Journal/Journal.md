# June 11, 2025 — How deep is your AI strategy?

Add your notes here…

**AI is everywhere, and conventional wisdom says you're falling behind if you're not using it.**

Naturally, many flock to ChatGPT, impressed by its knowledge and comprehension, and occasionally chuckled at its hallucinations.

As a software developer or organization building applications, what's your AI strategy? The conventional path seems clear: begin with ChatGPT, progress to frameworks like LangChain for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and ultimately develop sophisticated pipelines and agentic AI.

But here's the contradiction: the right way to use AI as a software developer should be using fine-tuning to improve on the models themselves.

RAG works by indexing external knowledge into vector databases and adding retrieved snippets to prompts—essentially giving the LLM a cheat sheet for each response. This approach has fundamental limitations: LLMs don't actually "learn" from these snippets; they merely reference them temporarily. The result? Inconsistent outputs and unnecessary system complexity.  LLM is literally one step removed for this corps of knowledge.

If you possess specialized data or domain knowledge, why compromise with this halfway measure? Instead of patching a base LLM with external retrieval, **fine-tune the model directly on your data**. Fine-tuning weaves your knowledge into the model's parameters, creating an inherently more intelligent and reliable solution for your specific needs.

Yes, RAG's popularity stems from its quick implementation and lack of costly retraining. But it's merely a temporary fix, not a lasting solution. Fine-tuning offers the true path to AI that deeply understands your domain, produces reliable results, and scales effectively.

**In short:**

Don't fall for the trend of layering retrieval onto base models. If you want AI that truly serves your users, make fine-tuning your primary strategy—not just an afterthought.

What's your perspective? Are you still depending on RAG, or have you embraced fine-tuning as the way forward?

**一、PCI术后用药的重要性**

经皮冠状动脉介入治疗（PCI，即心脏支架手术）后，规范的药物治疗是预防支架内血栓、再狭窄及控制动脉粥样硬化进展的关键。患者需长期坚持用药，以降低心血管事件复发风险，保护心脏功能。

**二、术后常用药物及注意事项**

**1. 抗血小板药物**

**常用药物：**阿司匹林、氯吡格雷、替格瑞洛等。

**作用：**防止支架内血栓形成，需联合使用至少1年（具体遵医嘱）。

**注意事项：**

- 严格遵医嘱服药，不可自行停药或调整剂量。
- 观察出血倾向（如牙龈出血、鼻出血、黑便等），轻微出血可咨询医生，严重出血需立即就医。
- 避免同时服用非甾体抗炎药（如布洛芬），可能增加出血风险。

**2. 他汀类药物**

**常用药物：**阿托伐他汀、瑞舒伐他汀等。

**作用：**降低胆固醇、稳定动脉斑块，需长期服用。

**注意事项：**

- 定期复查肝功能（每3~6个月）和肌酸激酶（CK），若出现肌肉酸痛、乏力需及时就诊。
- 避免大量食用西柚或饮用西柚汁，可能影响药物代谢。

**3. 降压药与降糖药**

**目标：**控制血压（＜140/90 mmHg）和血糖（空腹血糖≤7.0 mmol/L），降低心脏负荷。

**注意事项：**

- 每日监测血压、血糖，记录并复诊时携带数据。
- 不可因指标正常自行减药或停药。

**4. 其他药物**

- β受体阻滞剂（如美托洛尔）：减慢心率，减轻心脏耗氧。
- ACEI/ARB类药物（如培哚普利、缬沙坦）：保护心脏功能，改善预后。

**三、用药护理要点**

**1. 规律服药，避免漏服**

- 设定每日固定服药时间，使用分药盒或手机提醒辅助记忆。
- 若漏服，切勿加倍补服，需咨询医生或药师。

**2. 警惕药物相互作用**

- 就诊时需告知医生正在服用的所有药物（包括中药、保健品），避免与抗血小板药物冲突。

**3. 饮食与药物配合**

- 阿司匹林建议餐后服用以减少胃肠道刺激。
- 服用他汀类药物期间避免饮酒，防止肝损伤。

**四、自我监测与复诊**

**1. 定期复查：**术后1个月、3个月、6个月及每年需复查血常规、肝肾功能、血脂、心电图等。

**2. 症状观察：**若出现胸痛、胸闷、气促加重或持续不缓解，立即就医。

**3. 药物调整：**切勿自行换药，复诊时由医生根据检查结果调整方案。

**五、健康生活方式配合**

- 戒烟限酒：吸烟会加速血栓形成，酒精可能影响药物疗效。
- 合理饮食：低盐、低脂、高纤维，控制总热量。
- 适度运动：在医生指导下进行有氧运动（如步行、慢跑），避免剧烈活动。

**六、特别提醒**

抗血小板药物需长期服用：即使无不适，擅自停药可能导致支架内血栓，引发心梗甚至猝死！

出血与血栓的平衡：若需拔牙、手术或胃镜检查，需提前告知医生正在服用抗血小板药物。

PCI术后的规范用药是守护心脏健康的“生命线”。请牢记“按时、按量、长期坚持”的原则，配合健康生活方式和定期复诊，才能最大程度降低疾病复发风险，重获健康生活！

# May 13, 2025 — today’s 11.5 miles was better than recent runs.  Feeling that I was improving.

---

Today, ran to the turning point of the 5k race SU is organizing.  It was about 10 min per mile to and 9 min per mile back.  I wore the Xtep regular and it felt rather sitting back.

Joy returned home.  She immediately got quite allergic to cat hairs.  Had to vacuum her room.

# November 13, 2025 — Markdown Syntax Overview

**Prompt (10:20):** Can you give me a very quick overview of mark down file tag usage?

**Action:** Provided comprehensive Markdown syntax reference covering headers, text formatting, lists, links/images, code blocks, quotes, tables, and task lists.

# November 13, 2025 — Prompt Journaling Clarification

**Prompt (10:24):** did you journal my prompts?

**Action:** Explained that prompts are not automatically journaled. Described memory system capabilities and offered to create journal entries if requested.

---

# November 13, 2025 — Journal Location Correction

**Prompt (10:25):** I have been journal all my prompts in this project. Please check and continue the practice.

**Action:** Initially found `Writing/Vibe-Programming/ToDoAppPrompts.md` and added entries there. User corrected that all journaling should be in `Journal/Journal.md` at project root.

**Prompt (10:27):** No. I have been journal everything in this project rooted at root of this Windsurf project at Journal/Journal.md

**Action:** Corrected to use the proper journal file at `/Users/zan/z/attention/Journal/Journal.md`. Will continue documenting all prompts here going forward.

# November 13, 2025 — iPhone App Development Time Estimate

**Prompt (16:41):** Please remember to journal my prompts. Now, if I want to wrap my ToDoApp as an iPhone app, for a very experience developer with no iPhone app nor XCode experiences, how long will it take in man hours including learning curve?

**Action:** Provided detailed time estimate for wrapping ToDoApp as iPhone app for experienced developer new to iOS/Xcode. Broke down learning curve and implementation phases with hour estimates.

**Prompt (16:46):** Will using Windsurf to write all my code help? I have been using Windsurf for 98% for my coding.

**Action:** Analyzed how Windsurf/AI coding assistants impact iOS development timeline for first-time iOS developers. Estimated 15-25 hours with Windsurf, or 12-18 hours using Capacitor + Windsurf approach.

**Prompt (16:50):** Sounds great. Lets start. Please take this approach and give me step by step instructions, maybe start by creating a folder called iPhoneApp and create a projectPlan.md there so I can keep track of progress.

**Action:** Created iPhoneApp folder with comprehensive projectPlan.md containing step-by-step instructions for wrapping ToDoApp as iPhone app using Capacitor approach.

**Prompt (16:53):** Give me detailed instruction to install XCode. I use brew but that may not be relevant.

**Action:** Provided detailed Xcode installation instructions including both Mac App Store and Homebrew Cask methods, with verification steps and troubleshooting.

**Prompt (16:54):** Before I start, can you add the time estimates to my project plan? I will add the real time spent when I finish them so I can track.

**Action:** Updated projectPlan.md to add time estimates for each step and a time tracking section for actual vs estimated comparison.

**Prompt (16:59):** When I search for Xcode, I notice there is an Apple Developer. I assume, for my purpose, I will not need that, right?

**Action:** Clarified that "Apple Developer" app is different from Xcode. User needs Xcode (blue hammer icon), not Apple Developer app (red icon for managing App Store submissions).

**Prompt (17:03):** To make the app run on my own phone, I do not need App Developer, right?

**Action:** Confirmed that Apple Developer app is NOT needed to run on own phone. Only need: Xcode + free Apple ID account (add in Xcode preferences). No paid developer account or Apple Developer app required for personal device testing.

**Prompt (17:05):** Will the app continue to run after I un-tetherd my phone from my dev XCode?

**Action:** Explained that yes, app runs independently after deployment. With free Apple ID, app works for 7 days untethered, then needs re-deployment. With paid developer account ($99/year), app works for 1 year between re-deployments.

**Prompt (17:08):** I do not plan to ever do new development in XCode. My plan is to make change in my ToDoApp hosted in github, and port the change, as automatically as possible to the iPhone app. Will this setup you recommended work well for my intention?

**Action:** Confirmed Capacitor approach is perfect for this workflow. Changes to HTML/CSS/JS are automatically picked up. Workflow: 1) Edit ToDoApp code, 2) Run `npx cap sync`, 3) Deploy from Xcode (no Xcode editing needed). Can create script to automate sync step.

**Prompt (17:10):** No. That was my local deployed copy I made for demo purpose. My real version is in ToDoApp which is hosted on GitHub and docs folder in my project. Please correct your memory.

**Action:** Corrected understanding: Real ToDoApp is in `/Users/zan/z/attention/docs/` folder (GitHub Pages deployment), NOT the localhost:3000 server version. The iPhone app should wrap the GitHub-hosted web version that uses GitHub API with token authentication, not the local Bitbucket server version.

**Prompt (17:11):** Please update my project plan accordingly.

**Action:** Updated projectPlan.md to reflect correct ToDoApp structure: development in ToDoApp/, production in docs/, uses GitHub API (not localhost server), simplified Phase 3 since no server adaptation needed.

**Prompt (17:55):** Xcode is downloaded and installed.

**Action:** Confirmed Step 1.1 complete. Guiding user to verify installation and proceed to Step 1.2 (CocoaPods) and Step 1.3 (Capacitor CLI).

**Prompt (18:43):** Was having trouble install ERROR: Error installing cocoapods: The last version of activesupport (>= 5.0, < 8) to support your Ruby & RubyGems was 6.1.7.10. Try installing it with `gem install activesupport -v 6.1.7.10` and then running the current command again activesupport requires Ruby version >= 3.1.0. The current ruby version is 2.6.10.210. It has run into similar errors three times already with each time it ask me to install something else after a long time.

**Action:** Identified Ruby version issue (2.6.10 too old, needs >= 3.1.0). Recommended using Homebrew to install modern Ruby, then install CocoaPods. Alternative: skip CocoaPods for now since Capacitor can handle iOS dependencies.

**Prompt (18:50):** That was successful. What's next?

**Action:** Ruby 3.4.7 installed successfully via Homebrew. Now updating PATH, verifying Ruby version, and installing CocoaPods to complete Phase 1.

**Prompt (18:53):** It is done.

**Action:** Phase 1 complete (Xcode, Ruby, CocoaPods, Capacitor all installed). Starting Phase 2: initializing Capacitor project, creating config, and copying ToDoApp files.

**Prompt (19:02):** Got Communication with Apple failed. Your team has no devices from which to generate a provisioning profile. Connect a device to use or manually add device IDs in Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles. https://developer.apple.com/account/

**Action:** Provisioning profile error - need to either connect physical iPhone or switch to simulator-only testing. Guiding user to change signing settings to allow simulator testing without device registration.

**Prompt (19:04):** My iPhone is connected. I also see another error No profiles for 'com.attention.todoapp' were found. Xcode couldn't find any iOS App Development provisioning profiles matching 'com.attention.todoapp'.

**Action:** iPhone connected but provisioning profile not auto-generated. Guiding user to: 1) Verify Apple ID is added in Xcode, 2) Ensure "Automatically manage signing" is checked, 3) Trust device on iPhone, 4) Let Xcode regenerate profile.

**Prompt (19:33):** That did not work. I have to search on the internet. It turned out one has to enable Developer mode on the iPhone and then register the device in XCode. and Then select the device in a field on top of the XCode. Now it a profile is provisioned saying "Apple Development: zhian.job@gmail.com (...)". What to do next?

**Action:** User successfully enabled Developer Mode on iPhone and provisioning profile is now working. Ready to build and run app on physical device. Guiding to click Play button to deploy.

**Prompt (19:43):** Has to trust my developer's cert on my device. Now the app is working.

**Action:** SUCCESS! iPhone app is running on physical device. User completed Phases 1-4: environment setup, project creation, iOS platform initialization, and deployment. App successfully wraps GitHub Pages ToDoApp with GitHub API integration. Ready for Phase 5 (polish) or can start using immediately.

**Prompt (19:45):** Can you please add the "Updating Your App" instructions to README.md?

**Action:** Creating comprehensive README.md in iPhoneApp folder with setup summary, update workflow, troubleshooting, and important notes about 7-day expiration.

**Prompt (19:51):** Can you add an .gitignore in folder iPhoneApp to ignore the node_modules?

**Action:** Creating .gitignore in iPhoneApp folder to ignore node_modules, iOS build artifacts, and other generated files that shouldn't be committed to git.
