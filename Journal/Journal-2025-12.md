# Journal — 2025-12

> **Journaling rules for this repo (December 2025):**
> - All prompts for **2025-12** are journaled here, in chronological order.
> - **Every prompt must be logged verbatim** (quoted exactly as asked), followed by a brief Action note.
> - Do **not** reorder or rewrite existing entries; only **append** new ones at the end.
> - For other months/years, use `Journal/Journal-YYYY-MM.md` (e.g., `Journal-2026-01.md` for January 2026).
> - `Journal/Journal.md` is a historical archive and should not be reordered; treat it as read-only history.
