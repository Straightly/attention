# **Compliance-Friendly Design Document**

**AI Clinical Decision Support Tool for Diagnosis Validation**

# **🔹**

# **1. Purpose and Scope**

Name: Clinical Diagnosis Validator (CDV-AI)

Purpose: Assist licensed healthcare providers in validating existing diagnoses by identifying potential supporting or contradicting data from structured (labs, vitals, meds) and unstructured (clinical notes, discharge summaries) records.

Scope:

- Post-diagnosis support tool
- Clinical use only
- Does not suggest new diagnoses autonomously
- Not used for billing optimization

# **🔹**

# **2. Key Features**

| **Feature** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Evidence Summarizer | Highlights data elements that support or contradict a given diagnosis |
| Gap Checker | Flags missing documentation relevant to confirming or refuting the diagnosis |
| Clinical Relevance Engine | Uses clinical guidelines and peer-reviewed sources to match evidence to condition |
| Transparency Panel | Shows providers the logic path for every suggestion |
| Audit Trail | Logs all interactions, suggestions, and provider responses for compliance tracking |

# **🔹**

# **3. Data Inputs**

- Structured data: ICD-10 codes, CPT, lab results, medication lists, vital signs
- Unstructured data: Physician notes, radiology reports, pathology reports
- Metadata: Encounter type, care setting, diagnosis timestamp

🛡️ Note: Tool does not access billing codes or payer incentive structures.

# **🔹**

# **4. Intended Users**

- Primary users: Licensed physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants
- Secondary users (read-only mode): Clinical auditors, compliance teams
- Not intended for: Coding/billing teams, payers, revenue cycle departments

# **🔹**

# **5. Clinical Decision Support Behavior**

**🔍 Core Behaviors**

- Flags diagnoses with incomplete or contradictory documentation
- Recommends additional tests or evidence gathering, not diagnosis changes
- Never adds or edits diagnoses automatically

**🚫 Out-of-Scope Behaviors**

- No auto-upcoding or risk-score manipulation
- No generation of new conditions for reimbursement
- No scoring or ranking of diagnoses by financial impact

# **🔹**

# **6. Risk Management & Legal Safeguards**

**Compliance Design**

- Follows CMS and OIG guidance on clinical documentation integrity
- Built to support AMA CPT® and ICD-10-CM best practices
- Aligned with HIPAA, False Claims Act, and CMS RADV compliance

**User Safeguards**

- Every AI suggestion must be accepted, modified, or rejected by the provider
- All changes require attestation by the provider
- AI suggestions are accompanied by clinical rationale and source links

**System Safeguards**

- No provider performance scoring
- Disable for accounts linked to revenue teams
- Full audit logs stored and exportable for legal review

# **🔹**

# **7. Deployment and Training**

- Integrated into EHR or clinical review interface
- Provider training includes:
    - Compliance with CMS risk adjustment rules
    - Differentiating clinical vs. financial incentives
    - How to review AI suggestions responsibly
- 

# **🔹**

# **8. Documentation & Oversight**

- Compliance documentation maintained by internal legal team
- External clinical advisory board reviews logic and updates quarterly
- AI logic version control with published changelogs

# **🔹**

# **9. Evaluation & Monitoring**

- Monthly audits of AI suggestions and outcomes
- Random sampling of flagged cases for external compliance review
- Provider feedback channel for safety or integrity issues

# **✅ Final Statement**

This AI tool is designed strictly to support clinical accuracy, not to influence financial outcomes.

All final decisions are made by licensed providers in alignment with medical necessity and patient care standards.
