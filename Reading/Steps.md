**Verifying the Deal and Protecting Yourself First**

Before moving forward, it’s smart that you’re excited about the price, but cold-call offers can sometimes be too good to be true—especially in commercial real estate like apartment buildings, where scams involving fake wire transfers or identity theft aren’t uncommon. Start by protecting yourself with these immediate steps:

- **Confirm the Realtor’s Legitimacy**: Ask for their full license number and verify it through your state’s real estate commission website (e.g., via a quick search on the National Association of Realtors’ directory). Request references from past multifamily transactions and check reviews on sites like Google or the Better Business Bureau. If they’re representing an anonymous cash buyer, insist on proof of funds (e.g., a bank statement or escrow verification) before sharing any property details.
- **Sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)**: Have a real estate attorney draft a simple NDA before discussing specifics. This protects your financials, tenant info, and property data from being misused.
- **Red Flags to Watch**: Pressure for a quick close without due diligence, reluctance to provide buyer financials, or requests for upfront fees. If anything feels off, walk away—legit cash buyers won’t mind a thorough vetting process.

Hire a real estate attorney experienced in multifamily sales right away (cost: $1,000–$5,000 initially). They’ll handle contracts and flag issues. Also, loop in a CPA for tax implications early.

**Key Considerations Before Proceeding**

Selling an apartment building (multifamily property) is more complex than a single-family home due to tenants, leases, financing, and regulations. With a cash offer on a “pro forma” (a projected financial model), the buyer is likely basing their bid on your property’s income potential—great for you if it’s accurate, but verify their assumptions match your rent rolls and expenses.

- **Financial and Tax Impacts**:
    - **Price and Valuation**: Get an independent appraisal ($3,000–$25,000) using income capitalization (NOI divided by cap rate—expect 5–7% in 2025 markets), comparable sales, and cost approaches. Cash offers might be 10–20% below market to account for “as-is” risks, but yours sounds competitive.
    - **Taxes**: Capital gains could hit 15–20% federally, plus state taxes. Consider a 1031 exchange to defer taxes by rolling proceeds into another investment property (strict 45-day ID/180-day close timelines). Installment sales spread taxes over time if you’re retiring.
    - **Closing Costs**: Expect 7–10% of sale price (commissions, title fees, transfer taxes). Cash deals cut financing contingencies, saving time and risk, but budget for escrow and attorney fees.
- **Property-Specific Factors**:
    - **Tenants and Leases**: Review all leases, rent rolls, and security deposits. Cash buyers often buy with tenants in place, but disclose vacancies, evictions, or rent control issues. State laws (e.g., California’s Tenant Protection Act) may require notices.
    - **Condition and Liabilities**: Assess for code violations, environmental hazards (e.g., lead/asbestos), or service contracts (HVAC, management). Cash buyers typically waive seller inspections, but transparency avoids post-close disputes.
    - **Market Timing**: 2025 multifamily markets are stabilizing post-rate hikes, with cap rates rising slightly—good for sellers. But if interest rates drop further, financed buyers might compete, potentially upping your price.
- **Buyer and Deal Structure**:
    - Cash via entity? If your building is 1–4 units, note the new FinCEN rule (effective Dec. 1, 2025): Entities buying residential cash deals must report beneficial owners to combat money laundering. You (as seller) provide basic info, but it could add closing delays (30–60 days for reports). Larger buildings (>4 units) are exempt as “commercial.”
    - Pro forma risks: Ensure their projections aren’t overly optimistic—share your actual financials under NDA to refine the offer.
- **Your Goals**: Quick cash exit? Or max value with some repairs? Distressed sale? Align the deal accordingly.

**How to Proceed: A Streamlined Step-by-Step Plan**

Follow this condensed 17-step process adapted for cash buyers (full guide here 10 ). Aim for 30–90 days to close, faster than traditional sales.

1. **Assemble Your Team (Days 1–3)**: Attorney, appraiser, CPA, and possibly a broker (3–6% commission, but they negotiate better terms). If , skip the broker to save fees.
2. **Prep Your Property Docs (Days 4–7)**: Gather title report (clear liens?), rent rolls, leases, service contracts, recent inspections, and financials (3 years of P&Ls). Fix minor title issues now.
3. **Vet the Buyer and Negotiate Offer (Days 8–14)**: Send an NDA, then a Letter of Intent (LOI) outlining price, earnest money (1–3% non-refundable), inspection period (30–60 days, shorter for cash), and contingencies. Counter if needed—e.g., higher price for as-is sale.
4. **Due Diligence Phase (Days 15–45)**: Buyer reviews docs and inspects (physical, environmental). You provide access but hold back sensitive info until contract. For cash, this is abbreviated—no lender underwriting.
5. **Sign Purchase Agreement (Day 46)**: Attorney negotiates final terms, including lease assignments and warranties. Deposit earnest money in escrow.
6. **Pre-Closing Wrap-Up (Days 47–60)**: Get loan payoff quotes if mortgaged, notify tenants/vendors, and reconcile deposits. Address any buyer requests (e.g., minor repairs).
7. **Close the Deal (Day 61+)**: At title company/escrow. Sign docs, wire funds (verify instructions twice to avoid fraud), and transfer title. Walk away with net proceeds minus costs.

If the realtor suggests their platform (e.g., a cash buyer network), compare offers—no obligation.

**Final Tips for a Smooth, Protected Sale**

- **Budget Time and Costs**: Total process: 2–3 months, $5,000–$50,000 in fees depending on size.
- **Exit Strategy**: Plan post-sale—reinvest via 1031 or diversify.
- **When to Bail**: If due diligence uncovers buyer issues or the pro forma doesn’t hold, relist on marketplaces like LoopNet or Crexi for broader exposure.

This isn’t legal/financial advice—consult pros tailored to your state (e.g., NY vs. TX rules differ). If you share more details (location, building size, price range), I can refine this further!
