# No open weight LLM Medical Model

Excellent question ‚Äî and you‚Äôve touched on a subtle but important reality in today‚Äôs NLP landscape:

# ‚úÖ Yes, there are GPT-style (causal) models fine-tuned for medicine ‚Äî but they‚Äôre much rarer and often less open than BERT-based models.

**üß¨ Why So Many Medical BERT Models?**

1. üîí Privacy-Friendly: BERT models can be fine-tuned on smaller, private datasets (like clinical notes or abstracts) without requiring massive generation capabilities.
2. ü©∫ Ideal for Understanding Tasks: Tasks like:
    - Named Entity Recognition (NER)
    - ICD code prediction
    - Relation extraction
    - Document classification
    ‚Ä¶ are best handled by masked language models.
3. 
4. üìö Foundation: PubMed/BioBERT:
    - BioBERT (2019): BERT trained on biomedical literature.
    - ClinicalBERT: Fine-tuned on MIMIC-III clinical notes.
    - BlueBERT, SciBERT, PubMedBERT: All BERT variants focused on medical corpora.
5. 
6. üè• Easier Regulatory Fit: Easier to audit, deploy in hospitals or research.

**ü§ñ What About GPT-style Medical Models?**

GPT-style models do exist, but with caveats:

| **Model** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- |
| Med-PaLM / Med-PaLM 2 (Google) | Based on PaLM (a GPT-style LLM), fine-tuned on medical Q&A. High performance on USMLE but not open-source. |
| GatorTron (UF Health + NVIDIA) | GPT-like transformer trained on clinical notes, limited public access. |
| ChatDoctor / DoctorGLM | Open GPT-style models fine-tuned for medical conversation ‚Äî still early-stage and limited. |
| PMC-LLaMA / PMC-LLaMA-2 | LLaMA-based models trained on biomedical abstracts. Open, but not very robust yet. |
| MedAlpaca / Meditron | Open GPT-style models fine-tuned on medical data (mostly PubMedQA). Good demo potential, but not production-ready. |

**‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges with GPT-style Medical Models**

- Data availability: GPT-style models need huge, high-quality text for generation tasks (e.g., Q&A, case summaries).
- Hallucination risk: Generative models are more prone to making stuff up ‚Äî a big liability in medicine.
- Lack of transparency: Harder to interpret or trust than BERT-style models.
- Computational cost: Training or even finetuning GPT-style models is much more expensive.

**‚úÖ Summary**

| **Feature** | **BERT-style** | **GPT-style** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Most medical models today? | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ö†Ô∏è Rare |
| Best for structured tasks | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| Best for free-form generation / chat | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Available as open weights? | ‚úÖ Many | ‚ö†Ô∏è Few, mostly experimental |
| Examples | BioBERT, PubMedBERT, ClinicalBERT | Med-PaLM (closed), ChatDoctor (open) |

**üìå Bottom Line**

# For clinical NLP tasks, BERT-style models are still dominant and better supported.

# GPT-style medical models exist, but are fewer, riskier, and less open, though this is likely to change over the next 1‚Äì2 years.
