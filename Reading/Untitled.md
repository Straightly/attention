### Notes

- **Versioning**: Major releases are identified by the year.week format (e.g., 2024.26). Minor revisions (e.g., 2025.26.4) typically include bug fixes or hardware-specific optimizations and are not listed as separate major releases.
- **Rollout Variability**: Not all features are available on every model, year, or region due to hardware differences (e.g., AP3 vs. AP4, Intel vs. Ryzen MCU), regional restrictions, or software options like Full Self-Driving (FSD).
- **Data Sources**: The list is compiled from software update trackers and release notes, primarily from Teslascope, Not a Tesla App, and [ev-inventory.com](http://ev-inventory.com/), which provide detailed rollout statistics and feature lists.
- **FSD Beta**: FSD City Streets Beta releases (e.g., v12.6.4, v13.2.9) often lag behind main releases by 2–3 versions and are tracked separately in some sources.
- **Gaps**: Some weeks may not have major releases due to Tesla’s testing process or focus on minor updates. The list includes only significant feature-adding releases, not every incremental build.
