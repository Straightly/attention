# Id for an agent and the Ying and Yang of Security

Security of a AI agent is very important.  That goes without saying.  But how should one secure an AI agent?  We analyze the Ying and Yang of a security authority which clearly indicate that

1. An Agent should have the security exactly like an service.  However, we must
2. Plug a big hole in our current service security scheme where services which are two legged tokens.
3. To plug the hole, 
    1. Every running agent service must be deployed with authorities obtained through a chain of trust originated from an authenticated human being.
    2. Every running instance of a service will have to obtain authorities obtained through a chain of trust originated from the user.  

Granting of Authorities and use of the privileges:  The Ying and Yang of Security.  The use of the privilege is the yang of a security system.  Like dealing with Yang in any system, one must assume that the privileges will be used as much as possible.  For example, one must assume that any agent, when it required and could, will say whatever its origin of domain is, to access a privileged service that if the privileged service uses CORS.  In a secured system, the verification of authority is the mechanism to stop the Yang from an authorized use.  This is the process people are familiar with and understands well.

The granting of authorities is the Ying of security where the Yang is being kept in check.  This is 

An agent is a service.

Two legged token is flawed with gapping security hole.

The secured Yang of an agent so it can run.

The secured Yang of an agent so it can access the privileged resources.
