## 🔍 Recommended Review

### High Priority Files to Review
These files might benefit from manual review to ensure correct placement:

#### 1. **ChatGPT version.md** (currently in ToDos)
- Contains comparison content - might belong in Reading instead
- Location: `ToDos/ChatGPT version.md`

#### 2. Chinese Language Files
- `跑步，.md` (Misc) - Running-related personal note
- `接桃记：许家坝一棵毛桃树的变化` - Only has title, was correctly skipped
- Consider: Create a `Writing/Chinese/` subfolder if you write in both languages

#### 3. Book Files
Currently in Reading:
- `1984.md`
- `Brave New World.md`
- `The Diary of a Young Girl.md`
- `The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.md`
- `To Kill a Mockingbird.md`

Consider: Create `Reading/Books/` subfolder

## 🎯 For Paper Writing Workflow

### 1. Create Papers Folder Structure
```bash
cd /Users/zan/z/attention
mkdir -p Papers/Drafts Papers/Published Papers/References
```

### 2. Link Your Materials
- **Reading folder** = Your literature review materials
- **Writing/Ideas** = Seed ideas for papers
- **Journal** = Personal insights and reflections to draw from

### 3. Suggested Workflow
1. **Research Phase**: Add notes to `Reading/` with proper citations
2. **Ideation**: Capture thoughts in `Writing/Ideas/`
3. **Drafting**: Create paper drafts in `Papers/Drafts/`
4. **Reference Management**: Link to files in `Reading/` or copy to `Papers/References/`

## 🔧 Quick Commands

### Re-run Organization (if you add more Notion exports)
```bash
cd /Users/zan/z/attention
python3 organize_notion.py
```

### Find Files by Topic
```bash
# Find all AI/ML related files
grep -r "LLM\|GPT\|AI\|machine learning" Reading/ Writing/

# Find all files with "idea" tag
grep -r "Tags: Idea" Reading/ Writing/
```

### Create Subfolders
```bash
cd /Users/zan/z/attention/Reading
mkdir -p AI-ML Software Health-Medical Books People

cd /Users/zan/z/attention/Writing
mkdir -p Ideas Drafts Essays Chinese
```

## 📝 Files That May Need Attention

### Potential Miscategorizations
Review these files to ensure they're in the right place:

1. **Home.md** (Misc) - Check if this should be in ToDos
2. **Sample audio.md** (Misc) - Verify this is just a sample
3. Multiple **Untitled.md** files - Consider renaming with descriptive titles

### Empty Title Files
These files in raw materials only have titles (correctly skipped):
- `接桃记：许家坝一棵毛桃树的变化` - Peach tree story (title only)
- `跑意，跑翅...` - Running poem (title + "Notes" only)
- Various "Untitled" files with minimal content

## 💡 Tips for Future Organization

### 1. Better File Naming in Notion
- Use descriptive titles instead of "Untitled"
- Add tags consistently (Tags: Idea, Tags: Reference, etc.)
- Include dates for time-sensitive content

### 2. Regular Exports
- Export from Notion monthly or quarterly
- Run the organization script to keep folders updated
- Review and merge duplicate content

### 3. Cross-Referencing
Consider adding a `README.md` in each folder explaining:
- What belongs in that folder
- How files relate to each other
- Key themes or topics covered

## 🎓 Academic Paper Preparation

### Current Assets for Paper Writing:

**Strong Technical Content (Reading folder):**

## 🔨 BrokenPencil Project - Memory System for LLMs

**Status:** Planning & Early Development  
**Location:** `Writing/Broken-Pencil/`

### Phase 1: Core Memory System (Current Focus)
- [ ] Set up Bitbucket repository
- [ ] Design memory data schema (JSON/Markdown format)
- [ ] Implement basic CLI tool
  - [ ] `save` - Store memories with tags
  - [ ] `retrieve` - Search and retrieve memories
  - [ ] `list` - List all memories with filters
  - [ ] `delete` - Remove specific memories
- [ ] Integrate vector database (ChromaDB or similar)
- [ ] Implement semantic search with embeddings
- [ ] Create basic tagging system
- [ ] Write unit tests
- [ ] Create documentation and README

### Phase 2: LLM Integration (Planned)
- [ ] Design plugin architecture
- [ ] Create API for custom integrations
- [ ] Build plugins for AI tools (Cursor, Continue.dev, VSCode)
- [ ] Implement automatic memory extraction from conversations
- [ ] Build smart context injection
- [ ] Add per-project configuration

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Future)
- [ ] Multi-project memory isolation
- [ ] Collaborative memories (team knowledge bases)
- [ ] Memory analytics (usage stats, topic clustering)
- [ ] Conflict resolution for contradictory memories
- [ ] Memory lifecycle management (expiration, archiving)
- [ ] Web UI for memory management

### Immediate Next Steps
1. [ ] Set up Bitbucket repository structure
2. [ ] Choose tech stack (Python/TypeScript)
3. [ ] Design memory data schema
4. [ ] Implement basic file-based storage
5. [ ] Create CLI for save/retrieve operations
6. [ ] Post LinkedIn article announcing project

### Technical Decisions Needed
- [ ] Primary language (Python vs. TypeScript vs. Rust)
- [ ] Vector database (ChromaDB, Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant)
- [ ] Embedding model (OpenAI, local models, sentence-transformers)
- [ ] Storage format (JSON, YAML, Markdown with frontmatter)
