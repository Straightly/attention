On 11/26/2025, Lauren and Joy had a fight.  Joy took a lotion upstairs.  Laurent started shouting from downstairs.  Joy responded saying she took it by mistake because she thought it was being used because looked as if it was not even open.  I took it back down and explained to Lauren.   Lauren said "She did not.".  I responded firmly without raising my voice "She did.  She thought it was not opened and that it was a mistake to take it."  She grumbled something I did not hear but the case quite down and I went to the bathroom upstairs.  Then I heard Laurent stumped upstairs and said something to Joy.  I came out the batch room seeing Lauren standing in the middle of the sitting room in a tense jesture and shouted to her to stop as I thought she was accelerating the early argument.  

Then Joy explained that Lauren was actually offer to let Joy using the location.  I then apologied to Lauren.

Pretty sure if I should explain to Joy again.
1. I was involved to start with.
2. The situation I saw seemed to be still tense.
