# It is the structure, stupid!

I mean, literally!  there is no perceptions except one thing gets affected by another.

So in the real world, do not shy away from interacting with people.  That fact that there is another person you are interacting with, is already the biggest miracle of all:  Whether or not you like or dislike him or her.  He or she is one of the the people with whom you are common with.
