# NDA

**Important Disclaimer**

I’m not a lawyer, and this is **not legal advice**. This is a **sample Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) template** drafted based on standard practices for business purchase negotiations (drawn from common templates like those from LegalTemplates.net and Rocket Lawyer). It is provided for informational and educational purposes only. NDAs must be tailored to your specific situation, jurisdiction (e.g., state laws on enforceability), and the nature of your business. I strongly recommend having this reviewed and customized by a qualified attorney before using it. Using an unvetted NDA could expose you to risks, such as unenforceability or unintended liabilities. If you’re in the U.S., consider state-specific rules (e.g., California’s limits on non-competes).

This template is a **one-way (unilateral) NDA**, where you (the Seller/Disclosing Party) share confidential information with the Buyer (Receiving Party) during purchase negotiations. If you need a mutual (two-way) version or additions (e.g., non-compete clause), let me know for adjustments.

# **NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT**

**Date:** [Insert Date, e.g., October 5, 2025]

**Parties:**

This Non-Disclosure Agreement (the “Agreement”) is entered into between:

- **[Your Full Name or Business Name]**, located at [Your Address], (the “Disclosing Party” or “Seller”); and

**Recitals:**

WHEREAS, the Disclosing Party possesses certain confidential information regarding its business, assets, and operations (the “Business”);

WHEREAS, the parties are considering a potential purchase or acquisition of the Business by the Receiving Party (the “Transaction”);

WHEREAS, in connection with discussions and negotiations regarding the Transaction, the Disclosing Party may disclose Confidential Information (as defined below) to the Receiving Party;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained herein, the parties agree as follows:

**1. Definition of Confidential Information**

“Confidential Information” means any and all non-public information, in any form (oral, written, electronic, or otherwise), disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party, including but not limited to:

(b) Intellectual property, trade secrets, inventions, patents, copyrights, trademarks, know-how, and proprietary processes;

(c) Operational details, such as employee information, contracts, vendor relationships, and marketing materials;

(d) Any information marked or identified as “Confidential” at the time of disclosure, or which, under the circumstances, a reasonable person would understand to be confidential.

Confidential Information does not include information that:

(i) Is or becomes publicly available through no fault of the Receiving Party;

(ii) Was rightfully known to the Receiving Party prior to disclosure;

(iii) Is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Confidential Information; or

(iv) Is rightfully obtained from a third party without restriction on disclosure.

**2. Obligations of the Receiving Party**

The Receiving Party agrees:

(a) To hold the Confidential Information in strict confidence and not disclose it to any third party without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party;

(b) To use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of evaluating, negotiating, and potentially consummating the Transaction, and not for any other purpose;

(c) To limit access to the Confidential Information to its employees, advisors, or representatives (collectively, “Representatives”) who have a need to know for the Transaction and who are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective as those herein;

(d) To take reasonable security measures to protect the Confidential Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure, at least equivalent to those used to protect its own confidential information of similar importance; and

(e) Not to copy, reproduce, or reverse-engineer any Confidential Information without the Disclosing Party’s written consent.

**3. Duration of Obligations**

The obligations under this Agreement shall commence upon the date of disclosure and continue for a period of [Insert Term, e.g., two (2) years] from the date of this Agreement, or until the Confidential Information no longer qualifies as confidential under Section 1, whichever is longer. For trade secrets, the obligations shall continue indefinitely for as long as the information remains a trade secret.

**4. Return or Destruction of Confidential Information**

Upon the Disclosing Party’s written request or upon termination of negotiations, the Receiving Party shall promptly:

(a) Return all Confidential Information (including copies) to the Disclosing Party; or

(b) Destroy all such materials and certify in writing to the Disclosing Party that such destruction has occurred.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party may retain one archival copy solely for legal compliance purposes.

**5. No License or Ownership**

Nothing in this Agreement grants the Receiving Party any right, title, or interest in the Confidential Information. All Confidential Information remains the exclusive property of the Disclosing Party.

**6. No Obligation to Proceed**

This Agreement does not obligate either party to proceed with the Transaction or disclose any specific information. Each party reserves the right to terminate discussions at any time without liability, subject to the confidentiality obligations herein.

**7. Remedies for Breach**

The Receiving Party acknowledges that any breach of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which monetary damages may be inadequate. Accordingly, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief, in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity, without the need to post a bond.

**8. Governing Law and Jurisdiction**

This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of [Insert State, e.g., California], without regard to conflict of laws principles. Any disputes arising hereunder shall be resolved exclusively in the state or federal courts located in [Insert County/City, e.g., Los Angeles County, California].

**Next Steps and Tips**

- **Customization:** Fill in the brackets (e.g., dates, addresses, term length—2-5 years is common for business NDAs). Add a non-compete clause if needed (e.g., prohibiting the buyer from competing for 1 year post-termination), but note these are restricted in some states like California.
- **Signing:** Use electronic tools like DocuSign for remote signing. Have both parties date and initial each page.
- **Enforceability:** Include specifics about your business to strengthen protection (e.g., list key trade secrets in an exhibit).
- **When to Use:** Have the buyer sign this before sharing any sensitive details like financials or customer lists.

If this doesn’t fit your needs (e.g., mutual NDA, international, or specific clauses), provide more details, and I can refine it. Again, **consult a lawyer** to make it binding!
