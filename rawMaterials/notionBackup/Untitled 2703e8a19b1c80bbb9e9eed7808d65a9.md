Your 2018 Tesla Model 3, with Full Self-Driving (FSD) purchased from day one, entitles you to ongoing over-the-air software updates for FSD features as they roll out, provided your hardware supports them. These software upgrades are included in your original purchase and do not require additional payment—Tesla continues to push versions like FSD Supervised v12 and v13 to compatible vehicles. 2 However, the hardware side is more nuanced based on Tesla’s evolving policies and statements.

**Hardware Context for Your Vehicle**

- 2018 Model 3 vehicles typically shipped with Autopilot Hardware 2.5 (HW2.5). If yours hasn’t been upgraded yet, you’re eligible for a **free retrofit to Hardware 3 (HW3)** as part of your FSD purchase. This upgrade enables full access to current FSD Supervised features and is explicitly covered by Tesla’s original commitments to FSD buyers. You can check your current hardware in the vehicle’s software menu (Controls > Software > Additional Vehicle Information) or via the Tesla app. If it’s still HW2.5, contact Tesla Service to schedule the complimentary install—they’ve been doing these since 2019 on a rolling basis. 2 44
- The “latest” hardware as of September 2025 is Hardware 4 (HW4, also called AI4), which has been standard in new Teslas since early 2023. It offers improved processing power, better cameras, and supports more advanced FSD iterations (e.g., running higher parameter counts without as much optimization). 32 HW3 vehicles like yours (post-upgrade) are still receiving FSD updates, but they lag slightly behind HW4 in version rollout and performance—e.g., HW3 is on v12.6 while HW4 is on v13.2.x. 32 33

**Is an Upgrade to HW4 Covered by Your Original Purchase?**

- **Yes, it appears to be covered for full FSD purchasers like you, based on Tesla’s commitments and recent statements.** When FSD was sold in 2018, Tesla’s purchase agreement and marketing promised the hardware necessary to achieve full self-driving capability, implying any required upgrades would be provided to fulfill that. 9 In January 2025, Elon Musk explicitly stated: “We are going to have to upgrade Hardware 3 for people who bought FSD. That’s the honest answer. It’s going to be painful and difficult but that’s what we’re going to have to do.” 44 26 This upgrade (likely to HW4 or equivalent) is expected to be free for those who bought FSD outright, as it aligns with historical precedents like the HW2.5-to-HW3 retrofits. 25 28 Subscribers or those who added FSD later may not qualify for free hardware changes. 44
- That said, **Tesla has not yet started rolling out HW3-to-HW4 upgrades widely as of September 2025**. There have been no official timelines announced, and some reports indicate delays or lack of concrete plans even months after Musk’s admission that HW3 may not fully support unsupervised FSD without upgrades. 27 29 31 The process could involve not just the computer but also camera and wiring harness replacements, which adds complexity. 34 44 Tesla is prioritizing software optimizations for HW3 in the meantime, such as smoothness improvements. 43

**Next Steps**

- If you haven’t gotten the HW3 upgrade yet, request it through the Tesla app (Service > Request Service) or a service center—it’s straightforward and free.
- For HW4, monitor Tesla’s announcements or Elon’s X posts for rollout details. If unsupervised FSD (without driver intervention) becomes a reality and HW3 can’t handle it, your original agreement should obligate Tesla to provide the upgrade at no cost.
- If you’re concerned about timelines or want confirmation specific to your VIN, reach out to Tesla Support directly—they can review your purchase details.

Tesla’s FSD promises have faced scrutiny and lawsuits over the years for delays, but for early buyers like you, the hardware upgrade path seems protected under the original terms.
