# Ferritin doctor note

Below is a concise summary of your medical conditions and relevant context based on the information you’ve provided (ferritin of 1017 ng/mL, hemoglobin of 12.8 g/dL, RDW of 11.3%, MCV of 97 fL, glucose of 199 mg/dL, recent pneumonia, heavy red meat consumption, and marathon running with CGM use). This summary is designed to help you present your case clearly to your doctor in Seattle, ensuring all key details are included for a thorough evaluation.

**Summary for Doctor Consultation**

**Patient Background**:

- **Age/Sex**: [Not provided; include if relevant]
- **Lifestyle**: Amateur marathon runner, training regularly, using an over-the-counter continuous glucose monitor (CGM) to optimize race performance by tracking glucose fluctuations during runs.
- **Diet**: Recent heavy consumption of red meat (high in heme iron), now reducing intake.
- **Recent Illness**: Diagnosed with pneumonia (resolved, but timing relative to blood tests unclear).

**Recent Blood Test Results** (Date: [Not provided; include if known]):

- **Ferritin**: 1017 ng/mL (significantly elevated; normal range ~30–300 ng/mL for men, 15–150 ng/mL for women).
- **Hemoglobin**: 12.8 g/dL (low-normal for men [13.8–17.2 g/dL], normal for women [12.1–15.1 g/dL]; possibly lower due to endurance training).
- **RDW (Red Cell Distribution Width)**: 11.3% (low; normal range ~11.5–14.5%), indicating uniform red blood cell size.
- **MCV (Mean Corpuscular Volume)**: 97 fL (normal; range 80–100 fL), indicating normocytic red blood cells.
- **Glucose**: 199 mg/dL (elevated; prediabetes range 140–199 mg/dL if random, diabetes if fasting or symptomatic; context of test [fasting/random] unclear).

**Relevant Medical History**:

- Recent pneumonia, which may have contributed to elevated ferritin (acute-phase reactant) and glucose (stress hyperglycemia).
- No reported symptoms like fatigue, joint pain, or skin changes, but these should be clarified as they may relate to iron overload or anemia.

**Concerns and Goals**:

- **Primary Concern**: Very high ferritin (1017 ng/mL) raises suspicion for hereditary hemochromatosis, inflammation (possibly post-pneumonia), or other conditions (e.g., liver disease). Heavy red meat intake may contribute but likely not the sole cause.
- **Secondary Concerns**:
    - Low-normal hemoglobin (12.8 g/dL) may indicate mild normocytic anemia, possibly from inflammation, early iron overload, or marathon-related factors (hemolysis, plasma expansion).
    - Low RDW (11.3%) suggests uniform RBCs, consistent with early hemochromatosis or stable athlete physiology.
    - High glucose (199 mg/dL) suggests prediabetes or diabetes, possibly linked to iron overload (insulin resistance) or recent pneumonia.
- **Athletic Goals**: Using CGM to optimize marathon performance by monitoring glucose responses to diet and exercise. High ferritin/glucose may cause fatigue or glucose instability, impacting training/race outcomes.
- **Questions for Doctor**:
    - Is high ferritin due to hemochromatosis, post-pneumonia inflammation, or another cause?
    - Does low-normal hemoglobin or low RDW indicate anemia or other issues affecting performance?
    - Is glucose of 199 mg/dL a sign of prediabetes/diabetes, and how does it relate to ferritin?
    - Should I start therapeutic phlebotomy, and how will it affect my running?
    - How can I manage diet and training to support health and performance?

**Requested Tests/Evaluations**:

- **Full Iron Panel**: Serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), transferrin saturation (suspect >45% if hemochromatosis).
- **HFE Gene Test**: To confirm hereditary hemochromatosis.
- **Liver Function Tests**: ALT, AST to assess iron-related liver damage.
- **Repeat Glucose Tests**: Fasting glucose, A1C to confirm prediabetes/diabetes.
- **Repeat CBC**: To monitor hemoglobin, RDW, MCV post-pneumonia and during any treatment.
- **Inflammation Markers**: C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) to evaluate residual pneumonia effects.

**Current Actions**:

- Reduced red meat intake to limit iron absorption; focusing on low-iron proteins (e.g., chicken, fish).
- Monitoring CGM for glucose trends (e.g., spikes >180 mg/dL or drops <70 mg/dL) during runs and meals to guide fueling.
- Training regularly but concerned about potential fatigue or performance decline from blood abnormalities.

**Additional Notes**:

- Reside in Seattle; seeking local providers (e.g., UW Medicine, Swedish Medical, or Bloodworks Northwest for phlebotomy if needed).
- No known family history of hemochromatosis or diabetes [confirm with doctor].
- Willing to adjust training/diet based on medical advice to optimize marathon performance and health.

**Tips for Presenting to Your Doctor**

- **Bring Records**: Provide a copy of your lab results (ferritin, hemoglobin, RDW, MCV, glucose) and note the date/context (e.g., during/after pneumonia).
- **Describe Symptoms**: Mention any fatigue, joint pain, breathlessness, or changes in run performance, even if mild, as they may relate to iron overload, anemia, or glucose issues.
- **Share CGM Data**: Summarize glucose patterns (e.g., post-meal spikes or run-related dips) to highlight potential insulin resistance.
- **Mention Running**: Emphasize your marathon training (e.g., weekly mileage, intensity) as it may affect hemoglobin/RDW and inform treatment (e.g., phlebotomy timing).
- **Ask for a Plan**: Request a clear timeline for tests, treatment (e.g., phlebotomy if hemochromatosis), and follow-up, considering your race goals.

**Bottom Line**

Your ferritin (1017 ng/mL) is critically high, likely indicating hemochromatosis or post-pneumonia inflammation, with heavy red meat intake as a contributor. Hemoglobin (12.8 g/dL) and RDW (11.3%) suggest mild normocytic anemia or athlete-related changes, while glucose (199 mg/dL) raises concerns for prediabetes/diabetes, possibly linked to iron overload or pneumonia. See a doctor ASAP in Seattle for a full iron panel, liver tests, and glucose follow-up. Use this summary to ensure all details are covered, and share any new symptoms or CGM trends for further guidance!
