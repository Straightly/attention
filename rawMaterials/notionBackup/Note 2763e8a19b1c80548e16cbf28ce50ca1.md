Service Account for an Agent?  The answer is:  Don’t do it.  If the Agent is going to have a mind and may choose to do something of its own mind, then the service account should and must be limited to do EVERYTHING this service account is limited to do.  In other words, this service account must be limited to do ONLY things any person/people have the authority todo.  It is only logical that the Agent gain authorities only be allowed to access resourced.

Does it make sense to treat an agent like a human and give an agent the authorities like we give to a person?  That answer is no.  What must be insist up is that Agent can perform tasks on somebody’s and many people’s behave.  The authority with which the agent perform this agent come from somebody.  So the authorization eventually must be traced back to a person.  So tehre should be no identify for an agent.

The other way to understand is this:  Should an agent be given authority to your bank account?  No.  Should agent to be given authority to make this purchase, including transferring $99.99 to Amazon for this purchase?
