Yesterday evening, I was able to turn my todo app into an iPhone app. I had no experience writing iPhone apps and don't know any iPhone dev languages or environments. Windsurf estimated 50-60 hours originally. After going back and forth with options, we ended up with a plan of about 20 hours. In the end, we did it in about 3 hours. In the middle, I found something Windsurf was not able to do: I had to ask ChatGPT and then Google some errors trying to hook up my phone to Xcode, enable my phone for dev mode, and allow my phone to accept applications from my iPhone developer account. If it weren't for that, it would have been done in less than 2 hours. If Windsurf were sentient, it would be surprised itself.

# Follow-up: iPhone App Development

Hi everyone,

## The Challenge

Built a native iPhone app from my todo web app. Zero iOS experience (no Swift, no Xcode, never deployed to a device).

## The Numbers

- **Initial estimate:** 50-60 hours
- **Revised estimate:** ~20 hours (using Capacitor to wrap the web app)
- **Actual time:** ~3 hours

## The Gap

Windsurf handled everything except one thing: connecting my iPhone to Xcode and navigating Apple's device provisioning system. That 30-minute detour required ChatGPT and Google—Windsurf had no way to help with the physical device setup and Apple's ecosystem quirks.

Without that gap, it would have been under 2 hours.

## The Takeaway

The 85% reduction from revised estimate caught me off guard. Windsurf seemed to surprise itself (if it could). 

Thought it was worth sharing as another data point on where AI excels (code, config, automation) and where it still hits walls (platform-specific ecosystems, physical hardware).

Happy to chat more if anyone's curious about the details.

Best,

Zan + Windsurf (My message was a couple of lines and Windsurf edited it to include all the details you might interested.)
